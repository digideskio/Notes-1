<h1>CS 150 - Digital Design</h1>
<h2>August 23, 2012</h2>
<p>30 lab stations. Initially, individual, but later will partner up. Can
admit up to 60 people -- limit. Waitlist + enrolled is a little over
that. Lab lecture that many people miss: Friday 2-3. Specific lab sections
(that you're in). Go to the assigned section at least for the first several
weeks.</p>
<p>This is a lab-intensive course. You will get to know 125 Cory very
well. Food and drink on round tables only. Very reasonable policy.</p>
<p>As mentioned: first few are individual labs, after that you'll pair up for
the projects. The right strategy is to work really hard on the first few
labs so you look good and get a good partner.</p>
<p>The book is Harris &amp; Harris, Computer Design &amp; Architecture.</p>
<p>Reading: (skim chapter 1, read section 5.6.2 on FPGAs) -- H&amp;H, start to
look at Ch. 5 of the Virtex User's Guide.</p>
<p>H&amp;H Ch. 2 is on combinational circuits. Assuming you took 61C, not doing
proofs of equivalence, etc.</p>
<p>Ch. 3 is sequential logic. Combinational is history-agnostic; sequential
allows us to store state (dynamical time-variant system).</p>
<p>With memory and a NAND gate, you can make everything.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 is HDLs. Probably good to flip through for now. We're going to
use Verilog this semester. Book gives comparisons between Verilog and VHDL.</p>
<p>First lab next week, you will be writing simple Verilog code to implement
simple boolean functions. 5 is building blocks like ALUs. 6 is
architecture. 7, microarchitecture: why does it work, and how do you make
pipelined processors. May find there's actually code useful to final
project. Chapter 8 is on memory.</p>
<p>Would suggest that you read the book sooner rather than later. Can sit down
in first couple of weeks and read entire thing through.</p>
<p>Lecture notes: will be using the whiteboard. If you want lecture notes, go
to the web. Tons of resources out there. If there's something particular
about the thing Kris says, use <em>Piazza</em>. Probably used several times by
now, so not an issue.</p>
<p>Cheating vs. collaboration: link on website that points to Kris's version
of a cheating policy.</p>
<p>Grading! There will be homeworks, and there will probably be homework
quizzes (a handful, so probably 10 + 5%). There will be a midterm at least
(possibly two), so that's like 15%. Labs and project are like 10 and 30%,
and the final is 30%.</p>
<p>Couple things to note: lab is very important, because this is a lab
course. If you take the final and the midterm and the quizzes into account,
that's 50% of your grade.</p>
<p>Lab lecture in this room (306 Soda, F 2-3p). Will probably have five weeks
of lab lecture. Section's 3-4. Starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>Office hours to be posted -- as soon as website is up. Hopefully by
tomorrow morning.</p>
<h2>King Silicon</h2>
<p>FINFETs (from Berkeley, in use by Intel). Waht can you do with 22nm tech?
Logic? You get something more than <mathjax>$10^6$</mathjax> digital gates per <mathjax>$mm^2$</mathjax>. SRAM,
you get something like <mathjax>$10 Mb/mm^2$</mathjax>, Flash and DRAM, you get something like
<mathjax>$10 MB/mm^2$</mathjax>. You want to put your MIPS processor on there, or a 32-bit ARM
Cortex? A small but efficient machine? On the order of <mathjax>$10^5$</mathjax> gates, so
about <mathjax>$0.1 mm^2$</mathjax>. Don't need a whole lot of RAM and flash for your
program. Maybe a megabit of RAM, a megabyte of flash, and that adds up to
<mathjax>$0.3 mm^2$</mathjax>. Even taking into account cost of packaging and testing, you're
making a chip for a few pennies.</p>
<p>Think of the cell phone: processor surrounded by a whole bunch of
peripherals. I/O devices (speakers, screens, LEDs, buzzer; microphone,
keypad, buttons, N-megapixel camera, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis
gyroscope, 3-axis magnetometer, touchscreen, etc), networking devices
(cell, Wifi, bluetooth, etc), Cool thing here is that it means that you can
get all of these sensors in a little chip package. Something:
microprocessor in general will not want direct interface. A whole cloud of
"glue logic" that frees the processor from having to deal with
idiosyncrasies of these things. Lots of different interfaces that you have
to deal with. Another way of looking at this: microprocessor at the core,
glue logic around the outside of that, that is talking to the analog
circuitry, which talks to the actual transducers (something has to do
conversions between different energy domains).</p>
<p>another way of looking at this is that you have this narrow waist of
microprocessors, which connects all of this stuff. the real reason we do
this is to get up to software. one goal of this class is to make you
understand the tradeoffs between hw and sw. hw is faster, lower power,
cheaper, more accurate (several axes: timing, sw is more flexible. if we
knew everything people wanted to do, we'd put it in hw. everything is
better in hw, except when you put it in hw, it's fixed. in general, you've
got a bunch more people working in sw than in hw. this class is nice in
that it connects these two worlds.</p>
<p>if you can cross that bridge and understand how to understand a software
problem in hardware design stages, or solve a hw bug through software, you
can be the magician.</p>
<p>what we're going to do this semester in the project is similar to previous
projects in that we'll have a mips processor. looks like a 3-stage pipeline
design, and we'll have you do a bunch of hardware interfaces (going across
the hw/sw boundary, not into analog obviously). we have, for example,
video: we might do audio out. we'll do a keyboard for sure and a
timer. there's some things in here; all of this will end up being
memory-mapped io so that software on the processor can get to it, and it'll
also have interrupts (exceptions). not that many people who understand
interrupts and can design that interface well so that sw people are happy
with it.</p>
<p>You will <em>not</em> be wiring up chips on breadboards (or protoboards), the way
we used to in this class. You'll be writing in Verilog. You'll basically be
using a text editor to write Verilog, which is a HDL. There's a couple of
forms: one is a structural one, where you actually specify the nodes. First
lab you'll do that, but afterwards, you'll be working at a behavioral
level. You'll let the synthesis engine figure out how to take that
high-level description and turn it into the right stuff in the target
technology. Has to do a mapping function, and eventually a place &amp; route.</p>
<p>Lot of logic. Whole bunch of underlying techs you might map to, and in the
end, you might go to an IC where there's some cell library that the
particular foundry gives you. Very different than if you're mapping to a
FPGA, which is what you'll be doing this semester. Job of the synthesis
tool to turn text into right set of circuits, and that goes into simulation
engine(s), and it lets you go around one of these loops in minutes for
small designs, hours for larger designs, and iterate on your design and
make sure it's right.</p>
<p>Some of you have used LTSpice and are used to using drawing to get a
schematic, and that's another way to get into this kind of system as well,
but that's structural. A big part of this course, unfortunately, is
learning and understanding how these tools work: how I go through the
simulation and synthesis process.</p>
<p>The better you get at navigating the software, the better a digital
designer you'll be. Painful truth of it all. Reality is that this is
exactly the way it works in industry. Nature of the IC CAD world. Something
like a $10B/yr industry. Whole lot better than plugging into a board.</p>
<p>FPGA board: fast and cheap upfront, but expensive per part. Other part of
spectrum is to go with an IC or application-specific integrated circuit
(ASIC), which is slow and costly upfront, but cheap per unit. Something in
between: use an FPGA + commercial off-the-shelf chips, and a custom
PCB. Still expensive per part (less so), but it's pretty fast.</p>
<p>FPGA? Field-programmable gate array. The core of an FPGA is the
configurable logic block. The whole idea behind a CLB is that you have the
dataplane, where you have a bunch of digital inputs to the box, and some
number of outputs in the data plane, and there's a separate control plane
(configuration) that's often loaded from a ROM or flash chip externally
when the chip boots up. Depending on what you put in, it can look
different. Fast, since it's implemented at the HW level.</p>
<p>If you take a bunch of CLBs and put them in an array, and you put a bunch
of wiring through that array, that is configurable wiring.</p>
<p>If we made this chip and went through the process, when we turned it into a
single chip, we'd take everything we put into this, it'd be less than a
square millimeter of 22nm silicon.</p>
<p>Talk about how FPGAs make it easy to connect external devices to a
microprocessor.</p>
<p>Course material: we can start from systems perspective: systems are
composed of datapath and control (FSM), or we can start from the very
bottom: transistors compose gates, which get turned into registers and
combinational logic, which gets turned into state and next state logic,
which make up the control. Also, storage and math/ALU (from registers and
combinational logic) makes up the datapath.</p>

<h2>Admin</h2>
<p>Lab: cardkey, working on that. Not a problem yet. Labs: T 5:30-8:30, W 5-8,
Î¸ 5-8. Discussion section: looking for a room. Office hours online. &theta;
11-12, F 10:30-11:30. In 512 Cory.</p>
<p>Reading: Ch. 4 (HDL). This week: through 4.3 (section that talks about
structural Verilog). For next week: the rest. It is Verilog only; we're not
going to need VHDL. If you get an interview question in VHDL, answer it in
Verilog.</p>
<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>you've got HDLs, and there are really two flavors: VHDL and
Verilog. Inside of Verilog you've got structural (from gates) and
behavioral (say output is equal to a &amp; b).</p>
<h2>Abstraction</h2>
<p>Real signals are continuous in time and magnitude. Before you do anything
with signals, these days, you'll discretize in time and magnitude --
generally close enough to continuous for practical purposes. If it's a
serial line, there's some dividing line in the middle, and the HW has to
make a decision. Regular time interval called CLK; two values of
magnitude is called binary.</p>
<h2>Hierarchy</h2>
<p>Compose bigger blocks from smaller blocks. Principle of reuse -- modularity
based on abstraction is how we get things done (Liskov). Reuse tested
modules. Very important design habit to get into. Both partners work on and
define interface specification. Layering. Expose inputs and outputs and
behavior. Define spec, then divide labor.</p>
<p>One partner implements module, one partner implements test harness.</p>
<p>Regularity: because transistors are cheap, and design time is expensive,
sometimes you build smaller (simpler) blocks out of tested bigger
blocks. Key pieces of what we want to do with our digital abstraction.</p>
<p>Abstraction is not reality. Simulation: Intel FDIV bug in the original
Pentium. Voltage sag because of relatively high wire resistance.</p>
<p>Lab 0: our abstraction is structural Verilog. There are tons of online
tutorials on Verilog; Ch 4.3 in H\&amp;H is a good reference on that; your TAs
are a good reference. Pister's not a good reference on the syntax. You're
allowed to drop a small number of different components on your circuit
board and wire them up. If you want to make some circuit, you can.</p>
<p>Powers of two!</p>
<p>FDIV bug: from EE dept at UCLA: outraged that they had not done exhaustive
testing.</p>
<p>note: <mathjax>$1 yr \approx \pi \cdot 10^7 s$</mathjax>. With this approximation, <mathjax>$\pi$</mathjax> and
<mathjax>$2$</mathjax> are about the same. Combinatorial problem.</p>
<p>Combinational logic vs. sequential logic. Combinational logic: outputs are
a function of current inputs, potentially after some delay (memoryless),
versus sequential, where output can be a function of previous inputs.</p>
<p>Combinational circuits have no loops (no feedback), whereas circuits with
memory have feedback. Classic: SR latch (2 xor gates hooked to each other).</p>
<p>So let's look at the high-level top-down big picture that we drew before:
system design comes from a combination of datapath and control (FSM). On
the midterm (or every midterm Pister's given for this course), there's
going to be a problem about SRAM, and you're going to have to design a
simple system with that SRAM.</p>
<p>e.g. Given 64k x 16 SRAM design, design a HW solution to find the min and
max two's complement numbers in that SRAM.</p>
<p>Things you need to know about transistors for this class: you already know
them.</p>
<p>Wired OR (could be a wired AND, depending on how you look at it). Open
drain or open collector: this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Zero static power: CMOS inverter. Not longer true; power going down, but
number goes up. Leakage current ends up being on the order of an amp. Also,
increasingly, gates leak.</p>
<p>switching current: charging and discharging capacitors. <mathjax>$\alpha C V%2 f$</mathjax></p>
<p>crowbar current: <mathjax>$I_{CC}$</mathjax>, While voltage is swinging from min to max or
vice versa, this current exists. All of these things come together to limit
performance of microprocessor.</p>
<p>a minterm is a product containing every input variable or its complement,
and a maxterm is a sum containing every input variable or its complement.</p>

<h2>August 30, 2012</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Finite state machines, namely in Verilog. If we have time, canonical forms
and more going from transistor to inverter to flip-flop.</p>
<p>So. The idea with lab1 is that you're going to be making a digital
lock. The real idea is that you're going to be learning behavioral Verilog.</p>
<h2>Finite State Machines</h2>
<p>Finite state machines are sequential circuits (as opposed to combinational
circuits), so they may depend on previous inputs. What we're interested in
are synchronous (clocked) sequential circuits. In a synchronous circuit,
the additional restriction is that you only care about in/out values on the
(almost always) positive-going edge of the clock.</p>
<p>Drawing with a caret on it refers to a circuit sensitive on a positive
clock edge. A bubble corresponds to the negative edge.</p>
<p>If we have a clock, some input D, and output Q, we have our standard
positive edge-triggered D flip-flop. The way we draw an unknown value, we
draw both values.</p>
<p>A register is one or more D flip-flops with a shared clock.</p>
<p>Blocking vs. unblocking assignments.</p>
<p>So. We have three parts to a Moore machine. State, Output logic, and next
state. Mealy machine is not very different.</p>
<h2>Canonical forms</h2>
<p>Minterms and maxterms. Truth table is the most obvious way of writing down
a canonical form. And then there's minterm expansion and maxterm
expansion. Both are popular and useful for different reasons. A minterm is
a product term containing every input variable, while a maxterm is a sum
term containing every input variable. Consider min term as a way of
specifying the ones in the truth table. Construction looks like disjunctive
normal form.</p>
<p>Maxterms are just the opposite: you're trying to knock out rows of the
truth table. If you've got some function that's mostly ones, you have to
write a bunch of minterms to get it, as opposed to a handful of
maxterms. Construction looks like conjunctive normal form.</p>
<p>Both maxterm and minterm are unique.</p>
<p>de Morgan's law: "bubble-pushing".</p>

<h2>September 4, 2012</h2>
<p>FSM design: Problem statement, block diagram (inputs and outputs), state
transition diagram (bubbles and arcs), state assignment, state transition
function, output function.</p>
<p>Classic example: string recognizer. Output a 1 every time you see a one
followed by two zeroes on the input.</p>
<p>When talking about systems, there's typically datapath and the FSM
controller, and you've got stuff going between the two (and outside world
interacts with the control).</p>
<p>Just go through the steps.</p>
<h2>Low-level stuff</h2>
<p>Transistor turns into inverter, which turns into inverter with enable,
which turns into D flip-flop.</p>
<p>Last time: standard CMOS inverter. If you want to put an enable on it,
several ways to do that: stick it into an NMOS transistor, e.g. When enable
is low, output is Z (high impedance) -- it's not trying to drag output
anywhere.</p>
<p>It turns out (beyond scope of things for this class) that NMOS are good at
pulling things down, but not so much at pulling things up. Turns out you
really want to add a PMOS transistor to pull up. We want this transistor to
be on when enable is 1, but it turns on when the gate is low. So we stick
an inverter on enable. Common; called a pass-gate (butterfly gate). Pass
gates are useful, but they're not actually driving anything. They just
allow current to flow through. If you put too many in series, though,
things slow down.</p>
<p>Pass-gates as controlled inverters; can be used to create a mux.</p>
<p>SR (set/reset) latch. Requires a NOR gate. Useful thing about NOR and NAND
is that with the right constant, they can make inverters. That is why they
are useful in making latches (if we cross-couple two of them).</p>
<p>If S = R = 0, then NOR gates turn into inverters, and this thing
effectively turns into a bistable storage element. If I feed in a 1, it'll
force the output to be 0, which forces the original gate's input to be a 1.</p>
<p>Clock systems. Suppose we take our SR latch and put an AND gate in front of
S and R with an enable line on it, we can now turn off this functionality,
and when enable is low, S and R can do whatever they want; they're not
going to affect the outputs of this thing. You can design synchronous
digital systems using simple level sensitive latches.</p>
<p>Contrast with ring oscillator (3-stage; simplest). That is unstable -- if I
put an odd number of inverters in series, there is no stable
configuration. Very useful for generating a clock. Standard crystal
oscillator: Pierce configuration.</p>
<p>Odd number of stages unstable, two stages stable, more stages you have to
wrry about other things.</p>
<p>Can be clocked, but you have to be careful. For example: if I wanted to
design a 1-bit counter, with a clocked system, we can consider a
level-sensitive D latch. This is what happens when you get a latch in
Verilog. Otherwise, the synthesis tool well have it keep its previous
value. If you do that, it turns out that probably gives you enough delay
that when the clock is high, the output is 1; it'll probably oscillate. So
that's bad; maybe we'll make the enable line (the clock line) really
narrow. And not surprisingly, that's called narrow clocking. For simple
systems, you can get away with that. Make delay similar to single gate's or
a few gates' delay. However, ugly, and don't do that. Back in the day,
people did this, and they were simple enough that they could get away with
it.</p>
<p>What I really want is my state register and its output going through some
combinational logic block with some input to set my next state, and only
once per clock period does this thing happen. The problem here is in a
single clock period, I get a couple of iterations through the loop. So how
do I take my level-sensitive latch (I've turned it into a D latch with
enable, and that's my clock), and when clock is low, there's no problem. I
don't worry that my input's going to cruise through this thing; and when
it's high, I want my input (the D input) to remain constant.</p>
<p>As long as clock is high, I don't care; it'll maintain its state, since I'm
not looking at those inputs. There are a whole bunch of ways you can do it
(all of which get used somewhere), but the safest (and probably most
common) is to stick another latch (another clocked level-sensitive latch)
in front of it with an inverter. That's now my input.</p>
<p>So when the clock is low, the first one is enabled, and it's transparent
(it's a buffer). This is called an edge-triggered master/slave D flip-flop.</p>
<p>The modern way of implementing the basic D latch is by using feedback for
the storage element, and an input (both the feedback and the input are
driven by out-of-phase enable). My front end (the master) is driving the
signal line when the clock is low, and, conversely, when the clock is high,
the feedback inverter will be driving the line. Bistable storage element
maintaining its state, and input is disconnected.</p>
<p>Now, with the slave, same picture. Sensitive when clock is high, as opposed
to master, which is sensitive when clock is low. The idea is that the slave
prevents anything from getting into the storage element until it
stabilizes.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the rising edge of the clock latched D to
Q. Variation that happened after, doesn't propagate to master; variation
that happened before, slave wasn't listening. So now we have flip-flops and
can make FSMs.</p>

<h2>Verilog synthesis vs. testbenches (H&amp;H 4.8)</h2>
<p>There's the subset of the language that's actually synthesizable, and then
there's more stuff just for the purpose of simulation and testing. Way
easier to debug via simulation.</p>
<p>Constructs that don't synthesize:
<em> #t: used for adding a simulation delay.
</em> ===, !==: 4 state comparisons (0, 1, X, Z).
* System tasks (e.g. \$display, prints to console in a C printf-style
  format that's pretty easy to figure out; \$monitor, prints to console
  whenever its arguments change)</p>
<p>In industry, it's not at all uncommon to write the spec, write the
testbench, then implement the module. Once the testbench is written, it
becomes the real spec. "You no longer have bugs in your code; you only have
bugs in your specification."</p>
<p>How do we build a clock in Verilog?</p>
<pre><code>parameter halfT = 5;
reg CLK;
initial CLK = 0;
always begin
    #(halfT) CLK = ~CLK;
end
</code></pre>
<p>H&amp;H example 4.39 shows you how to read from a file.</p>
<pre><code>silly_function(.a(a), .b(b), .c(c), .s(s));

reg [3:0] testvect[10000:0];
$readmemb("test.tv", testvect); // done when input is 4 bits of X (don't care)

always @(posedge CLK)
    #1 assign {a, b, c, out_exp} = testvect[num]

always @(negedge CLK) begin
    if (s !== out_exp) $display("error ... ");
    num &lt;= num + 1;
end
</code></pre>
<p>How big can you make shift registers? At some point, IBM decreed that every
register on every IBM chip would be part of one gigantic shift register. So
you've got your register file feeding your ALU; it's a 32 x 32
register. There's a test signal; when it's high, the entire thing becomes
one shift register. Why? Testing. This became the basis of JTAG. Another
thing: dynamic fault imaging. Take a chip and run it inside a scanning
electron microscope. Detects backscatter from electrons. Turns out that a
metal absorbs depending on what voltage they're at, and oxides absorb
depending on the voltage of the metal beneath them. So you get a different
intensity depending on the voltage.</p>
<p>We can also take these passgates and make variable interconnects. So if
I've got two wires that don't touch, I can put a passgate on there and call
that the connect input.</p>
<p>Last time we talked about MUXes. I can make a configurable MUX -- the MUX,
we did a two-to-one mux, and if I've got some input over here, I select
according to what I have as my select input.</p>
<p>Next time: more MIPS, memory.</p>

<h1>CS 150: Digital Design &amp; Computer Architecture</h1>
<h2>September 11, 2012</h2>
<p>Changed office hours this week. CLBs, SAR, K-maps.</p>
<p>Last time: we went from transistors to inverters with enable to D-flipflops
to a shift register with some inputs and outputs, and, from there to the
idea that once you have that shift register, then you can hook that up with
an n-input mux and make an arbitrary function of n variables.</p>
<p>This gives me configurable logic and configurable interconnects, and
naturally I take the shift out of one and into another, and I've got an
FPGA.</p>
<p>The LUT is the basic building block: I get four of those per slice, and
some other stuff: includes fast ripple carry logic for adders, the ability
to take two 6s and put them together to form a 7-LUT. So: pretty flexible,
fair amount of logic, and that's a slice. One CLB is equal to two slices.</p>
<p>And I've got, what is that, 8640 CLBs per chip. Also: DSP48 blocks. 64 of
these, and each one is a little 48-bit configurable ALU. So that gives you
something like 70000 (6-LUTs + D-ff). So that's what you've got, what we
work with.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about a successive approximation register analog to digital
converter. A very popular device. Link to a chip that implemented the
digital piece of this thirty years ago. Why are we looking at this? It's
nice; it's an example of a "mixed-signal" (i.e. analog mixed with digital
in the same block, where you have a good amount of both) system.</p>
<p>It turns out that analog designers need to be good digital designers these
days. I was doing some consulting for a company recently. They had
brilliant analog designers, but they had to do some digital blocks on their
chips.</p>
<p>"Real world" interfaces. Has some number of output bits that go into the
DAC; the DAC's output is simply "linear". You trust the analog designer to
give you this piece, and the digital comparator sample and hold circuit,
with the sample input, and here's your analog input voltage. So real quick
we'll look at what's in those blocks (even though this isn't 150
material). S/H: simplest example is just a transistor. Maybe it's a
butterfly gate; typically, there's some storage capacitor on the outside so
that if you've got your input voltage; when it goes low, that is held on
there.</p>
<p>Maybe there's some buffer amplifier (little CMOS opamp so it can drive nice
loads); capacitive input, so signal will stay there for a long time. Not
150 material.</p>
<p>The DAC, a simple way of making this is to generate a reference voltage
(diode-connected PMOS with voltage division, say). which you mirror, tied
together with a switch, and all of these share the same gate. Comparator's
a little more subtle. Maybe when we talk about SRAMs and DRAMs.</p>
<p>Anyway. So. Now we have the ability to generate an analog voltage under
digital control. We sample that input and are going to use that
signal. This tells us whether the output of the DAC is too big. That
together is called a SAR.</p>
<p>So what does that thing do? There's a very simple (dumb) SAR: a
counter. From reset in time, its digital output increases linearly; at some
point it crosses the analog <mathjax>$V_{in}$</mathjax>, and at that point, you stop. But:
that's not such a great thing to do: between 1 and 1024 cycles to get the
result. The better way is to do a binary search. Fun to do with
dictionaries and kids. Also works here. FSM: go bit-by-bit, starting with
most significant bit.</p>
<p>Better solution (instead of using oversized tree -- better in the sense of
less logic required): use a shift register (and compute all bits
sequentially). Or counter going into a decoder; sixteen outputs of which I
only need 10.</p>
<p>Next piece: another common challenge and where a lot of mistakes get made:
analog stuff does not simulate as well. While you're developing and
debugging, you have to come up with some way of simulating.</p>
<p>Good news: you can often go in and fix things like that. Sort of an aside
(although it sometimes shows up in my exams), once you put these
transistors down, and then you've got all these layers of metal on
top. Turns out that you can actually put this thing in a scanning electron
microscope and use undedicated logic and go in with a FIB (focused ion
beam) and fix problems. "Metal spin".</p>
<p>Back to chapter two: basic gates again. de Morgan's law: <mathjax>$\bar{AB} =
\bar{A} + \bar{B}$</mathjax>: <mathjax>$\bar{\prod{A_i}} = \sum \bar{A_i}$</mathjax>. Similarly,
<mathjax>$\bar{\sum{A_i}} = \prod \bar{A_i}$</mathjax>. Suppose you have a two-level NAND/NAND
gate: that becomes a sum of products (SoP). Similarly, NOR/NOR is
equivalent to a product of sums (PoS).</p>
<p>Now, if I do NOR/NOR/INV, this is a sum of products, but the inputs are
inverted. This is an important one. This particular one is useful because
of the way you can design logic. The way we used to design logic a few
decades ago (and the way we might go back in the future) was with big long
strings of NOR gates.</p>
<p>So if I go back to our picture of a common source amplifier (erm,
inverter), and we stick a bunch of other transistors in parallel, then we
have a NOR gate. Remember: MOS devices have parasitic capacitance.</p>
<p>Consider another configuration. Suppose we invert our initial input and
connect to both of these a circled wire, which can be any of the following:
fuse / anti-fuse, mask-programmable (when you make the mask, decision to
add a contact), transistor with flipflop (part of shift register, e.g.), an
extra gate (double-gate transistors).</p>
<p>So now if I chain a bunch more of these together (all NOR'd together, then
I can program many functions. In particular, it could just be an inverter.</p>
<p>I can put a bunch of these together, and I can combine the function outputs
with another set of NORs, invert it all at the end, and I end up with
NOR/NOR/INV.</p>
<p>These guys are called PLAs (programmable logic arrays), and you can still
buy them, and they're still useful. Not uncommon to have a couple of
flipflops on them. Will have a homework assignment where you use a 30 cent
PLA and design something. Quick and dirty way of getting something for
cheap.</p>
<p>Not done anymore because slow (huge capacitances), but may come back
because of carbon nanotubes. Javey managed to make a nanotube transistor
with a source, drain, gate, and he got transport, highest current density
per square micron cross-section ever, and showed physics all worked, and
this thing is 1nm around. What Prof. Ali Javey's doing now is working with
nanowires and showing that you can grow these things on a roller and roll
them onto a surface (like a plastic surface), and putting down layers of
nanowires in alternating directions.</p>
<p>You can imagine (we're a ways away from this) where you get a transistor at
each of these locations, and you've got some CMOS on this side generating
signals, and CMOS on the output taking the output (made with big fat
gigantic 14nm transistors), and you can put <mathjax>$10^5$</mathjax> transistors per square
micron (not pushing it, since density can get up to <mathjax>$10^6$</mathjax>). End of road
for CMOS doesn't mean you ditch CMOS. Imagine making this into a jungle
gym; then you're talking about <mathjax>$10^8$</mathjax> carbon nanotubes per cubic micron,
etc. The fact that we can make these long thin transistors on their lengths
means that this might come back into fashion.</p>

<h1>CS 150: Digital Design &amp; Computer Architecture</h1>
<h2>September 13, 2012</h2>
<p>Questions of the form 16x16 SRAM, design a circuit that will find the
smallest positive integer or biggest even number, or count number of times
17 appears in memory, etc. Kris loves these questions where you figure out
design (remember: separate datapath and control, come up with it on your
own) -- will probably show up on both midterm and final.</p>
<p>Office hours moved.</p>
<p>So... last time, we were talking about PLAs (prog logic array) and stuff
(NOR/NOR equivalent to AND/OR). You'll hear people talking about AND plane
and OR plane, even though they're both NORs. If you look at Fig 2.2.3,
they'll show the same regular and inverted signals, and they just draw this
as a line with an AND gate at the end. Pretty common way to draw this;
lines with OR gates.</p>
<p>Variant of PLA called a PAL -- subsets of "product" terms going to "OR"
gates.</p>
<p>Beginning of complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs, FPGAS). You can
still buy these registered PALs.</p>
<p>Why would you use this over a microprocessor? Faster. Niche. The "oh crap"
moment when you finish your board and you find that you left something
out.</p>
<p>I want to say a little about memory, because you'll be using block ram in
your lab next week. There's a ton of different variations of memory, but
they all have a couple of things in common: a decoder (address decoder)
where you take <mathjax>$n$</mathjax> input bits and turn them into <mathjax>$2^n$</mathjax> word lines in a
memory that has <mathjax>$2^n$</mathjax> words. Also have cell array. Going through cell array
you have some number of bit lines, we'll call this either <mathjax>$k$</mathjax> or <mathjax>$2k$</mathjax>,
depending on the memory. That goes into some amps / drivers, and then out
the other side you have <mathjax>$k$</mathjax> inputs and/or outputs. Sometimes shared
(depends whether or not there's output-enable). Write-enable,
output-enable, sometimes clock, sometimes d-in as well as d-out, sometimes
multiple d-outs (multiple address data pairs); whole bunch of variation in
how this happens. Conceptually, though all comes down to something that
looks like this.</p>
<p>So what's that decoder look like? Decoders are very popular circuits: they
generate all minterms of their input (gigantic products). Note that if you
invert all of the outputs, we get the maxterms (sums).</p>
<p>That was DRAM. Now, SRAM:</p>
<p>Still have word line going across; now I have a bit line and negated bit
line. Inside, I have two cross-coupled inverters (bistable storage
element). Four transistors in there: already down (vs. 1), and I still have
to access. Access transistor going to each side, hooked up to the word
line. When I read this thing, I put in an n-bit address, and the
transistors pull the bit lines. We want these as small as possible for the
bit density. 6T, sense amp needed. You can imagine that what you usually do
is pre-charge <mathjax>$BL$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$\bar{BL}$</mathjax>. As soon as you raise the word line for this
particular row, what you find is that one of them starts discharging, and
the other is constant. Analog sensing present so you can make a decision
much much faster.</p>
<p>That's how reads work; writes are interesting. Suppose I have some
<mathjax>$D_{in}$</mathjax>, what do I do? I could put an output-enable so that when writing,
they don't send anything to the output, but that would increase size
significantly. So what do I do? I just make big burly inverters and drive
the lines. Big transistors down there overcome small transistors up there;
and they flip the bit. PMOS is also generally weaker than NMOS, etc. Just
overpower it. One of rare times that you have PMOS pulling up and NMOS
pulling down. (notion of "bigger": <mathjax>$W/L$</mathjax>).</p>
<p>Transistors leak. They can leak a substantial amount. By lowering voltage,
I reduce power. It turns out there's a nonlinear relationship here, and so
the transistors leak a lot less.</p>
<p>So that's SRAM. The other question? What about a register? What's the
difference between this and a register file? Comes back to what's in the
cell array. We talked that a register is a bunch of flipflops with a shared
clock and maybe a shared enable. Think of a register as having the common
word line, and you've got a D flipflop in there. There's some clock shared
across the entire array, and there's an enable on it and possibly an
output, depending on what kind of system you've got set up. We've got D-in,
D-out, and if I'm selecting this thing, presumably I want output-enable; if
I'm writing, I need to enable write-enable.</p>
<p>So. You clearly have the ability to make registers on chips, so you can
clearly do this on the FPGA. Turns out there's some SRAMs on there,
too. There's an external SRAM that we may end up using for the class
project, and there's a whole bunch of DDR DRAM on there as well.</p>
<h2>Canonical forms</h2>
<p>Truth tables, minterm / maxterm expansions. These we've seen.</p>
<p>If you have a function equal to the sum of minterms 1,3,5,6,7, we could
implement this with fewer gates by using the maxterm expansion.</p>
<p>"Minimum sum of products", "minimum product of sums".</p>
<h2>Karnaugh Maps</h2>
<p>Easy way to reduce to minimum sum of products or minimum product of
sums. (Section 2.7). Based on the combining theorem, which says that <mathjax>$XA +
X\bar{A} = X$</mathjax>. Ideally: every row should just have a single value
changing. So, I use Gray codes. (e.g. 00, 01, 11, 10). Graphical
representation!</p></div><div class='pos'></div>
