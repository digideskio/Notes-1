<p>Since the course is not HW-heavy, there are weeks we don't have
homework. So get together with groups and plow through old exams.</p>
<p>The other thing you can do is look at a couple of books. Most of them
are with this title: Signals &amp; Systems. One of them is by Oppenheim,
Willsky, Nawab. This one's an expensive book, actually. Don't
recommend you go out and buy it unless you can find one printed
overseas. Excellent problems -- mostly MIT exams. Taught out of this
book previously. (both are second-edition)</p>
<p>There's another one with the same title by Hwei P. Hsu (Schaum's
Outline) -- great for self-study because every problem is solved.</p>

  + occurs, e.g. when something that isn't an input is time-dependent.
* Causality
  + Basically, no dependence on future values.
- If two inputs are identical to some point, then their outputs
  must also be identical to that same point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>EE 120: Signals and Systems</h1>
<h2>January 19, 2012.</h2>
<h2>More on causality</h2>
<p>(proof by contradiction of previous example)</p>
<p>(input zero up to a certain point, but the output is nonzero before said
point. output preceding input. In itself, it does not tell non-causality,
but if you know the system is either linear or time-invariant, then you
know it can't be causal.)</p>
<p>L and C implies not P</p>
<p>If the system is linear AND causal, output cannot precede the input.</p>
<p>contrapositive: P implies not (L and C) = not L or not C.</p>
<p>for time invariance, we don't have to insist that the input is zero up to a
point; it just has to be (any) constant. Output also doesn't have to be
zero; it just has to be constant (not necessarily the same constant,
obviously).</p>
<p>(TI and C) implies not P
contrapositive: P implies not TI or not C.</p>
<p>anti-causality is defined as the exact opposite of causality. Everything
we've said about causality, the inequalities change sign.</p>
<h2>Bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability.</h2>
<p>if <mathjax>$\abs{x(n)} \le Bx (\exists Bx &lt; \infty) \implies \exists 0 &lt; By &lt;
\infty \text{ s.t. } \abs{y(n)} \le By \forall n$</mathjax></p>
<p>every FIR (finite-duration impulse response filter) is BIBO stable.</p>
<h2>LTI (linear time-invariant) systems</h2>
<p><mathjax>$x(n)$</mathjax> can in general be decomposed into into a linear combination of
impulses. (Kr\"onecker deltas). <mathjax>$x(n) = \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty
x(m)\delta(n-m)$</mathjax>. (sifting property)</p>
<p>If you know the response of the LTI system to the unit impulse, you know
the response to all discrete-time inputs -- decompose it into unit
impulses.</p>
<p>convolution sum.
<mathjax>$$
x(n) = \sum_m x(m) \delta(n-m)
\\ y(n) = \sum_m x(m)f(n-m)
\\ y(n) = (x * f)(n)
\\ y(n) = \sum_m^\infty x(m)f(n-m) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty f(k)x(n-k)
\\ = (f*k)(n)
\\ \therefore x * f = f * x
$$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>You can reverse the roles of the impulse response and the input signal.</p>
<p>Let <mathjax>$x(n) = e^{i\omega n}$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$y(n) = F(\omega) = (\sum_k f(k)e^{-i\omega
k})e^{i\omega n}$</mathjax>.  Frequency response of this LTI system.</p>
<p>Converges nicely iff the system is BIBO-stable. The frequency response of
the system will be a very smooth function of omega.</p>
<h2>BIBO stability for LTI systems</h2>
<p>An LTI system F is BIBO stable iff its impulse response converges
(absolutely summable in discrete case or integrable in continuous case).</p>
<p>IF the impulse response is absolutely summable, then F is BIBO stable
(every bounded input produces a bounded output).</p>
<p><mathjax>$$y(n) = \sum_k f(k)x(n-k) \text{ (I/O relation for an LTI system)}.
\\ \abs{y(n)} = \abs{\sum_k f(k)x(n-k)} \le \sum_k \abs{f(k)}\abs{x(n-k)}
\\ \abs{x(n)} \le Bx \forall n.           \le (\sum_k \abs{f(k)})Bx$$</mathjax></p>
<p>F is BIBO stable <mathjax>$\implies \sum_n \abs{f(n)} &lt; \infty$</mathjax></p>
<p>contrapositive. i.e. we can find at least one bounded input that produces
an unbounded output.</p>
<p>(fudge something to cancel out signs; we create our absolute sum over all
integers @ n=0. convolve signal with time-reversed signal;
auto-correlation. convolution of a signal with itself.)</p>
<p><mathjax>$\frac{f(n)^2}{\abs{f(n)}} = \abs{f(n)}^2/\abs{f(n)} = \abs{f(n)}$</mathjax></p>
<h2>IIR Filters</h2>
<p><mathjax>$y(n) = \alpha y(n-1) + x(n)$</mathjax>.  causal, <mathjax>$y(-1) = 0$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>(geometric sum; BIBO stability depends on magnitude of \alpha being less
than
1.)</p>

<h1>LTI Systems and Frequency Response</h1>
<p>Freq. response: <mathjax>$H(\omega)$</mathjax>
(continuous-time?)</p>
<p>Will learn set of systems for which sum doesn't converge, so we'll need a
new transform: laplace (Z) transform</p>
<h2>Two-point moving average:</h2>
<p><mathjax>$h(n) = (\delta(n) + \delta(n-1))/2$</mathjax></p>
<p><mathjax>$H(\omega) = (1 + e^{-i\omega})/2 = e^{-i\omega /2}(e^{i\omega /2} +
     e^{-i\omega /2})/2 = e^{-i\omega/2}cos(\omega/2)$</mathjax></p>
<p>frequency response of discrete-time systems is periodic: adding a multiple
of <mathjax>$2\pi$</mathjax> will not change the result.</p>
<p><mathjax>$2\pi$</mathjax>-periodicity of discrete-time LTI frequency responses. This means,
naturally, that we don't have to plot our functions everywhere; rather, we
only need to worry about a single period.</p>
<p>(looks like <mathjax>$\abs{cos(\frac{\omega}{2})})$</mathjax></p>
<p>eigenfunction property of discrete LTI systems -- <mathjax>$e^{i\omega} \to
H(\omega)e^{i\omega}$</mathjax></p>
<p><mathjax>$H^*(\omega) = \sum h^*(k)e^{i\omega k}$</mathjax></p>
<p>conjugate symmetry: <mathjax>$H^*(\omega) = H(-\omega)$</mathjax>. (generalization of "even"
functions)</p>
<p>if <mathjax>$h(n) \in \mathbb{R} \forall n$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$y(n) = Re{H(\omega)e^{i\omega n}} =
|H(\omega )|cos(\omega n+\angle H(\omega))$</mathjax></p>
<p><mathjax>$x\to H\to y$</mathjax></p>
<p><mathjax>$h(n) = (1-\alpha ^n)/(1-\alpha)$</mathjax></p>
<p>Ways to determine H(\omega):</p>
<h2>Method 1:</h2>
<p><mathjax>$H(\omega) = \sum h(n)e^{-i\omega n} = \sum (\alpha e^{-i\omega})^n$</mathjax>. Use
usual formula for geometric series, since this converges.</p>
<h2>Method 2:</h2>
<p>Use eigenfunction property of the complex exponential. Frequency response
is probably defined. Let <mathjax>$x(n) \equiv e^{i\omega n}$</mathjax> (a pure tone).</p>
<p><mathjax>$y(n) = H(\omega)e^{i\omega n}. y(n-1) = H(\omega)e^{i\omega n}e^{-i\omega}$</mathjax>.
<mathjax>$H(\omega) = 1/(1-\alpha e^{-i\omega})$</mathjax>.</p>
<h2>How we can plot the magnitude response</h2>
<p>eliminate all negative complex exponentials. <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> is in the unit
circle. <mathjax>$e^{i\omega}$</mathjax> is a point on the unit circle, so we can represent it
with a vector.</p>
<p>Consider graphically.</p>
<h1>EE 120: Signals and Systems</h1>
<h2>January 26, 2012.</h2>
<p>numerator is 1, denominator is length of vector <mathjax>$e^{i\omega} -
\alpha$</mathjax>. Task: plot ratio as <mathjax>$\omega$</mathjax> varies.</p>
<p><mathjax>$1/(1+\alpha), 1/(1-\alpha)$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>frequency response curve should be monotonically increasing from <mathjax>$-\pi$</mathjax> to
0 and decreasing from 0 to <mathjax>$\pi$</mathjax>. [ talk about inflection points, concavity,
etc. Second derivatives. ]</p>
<h1>Low-pass filter for <mathjax>$0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$</mathjax>. If we understand the geometry for this</h1>
<p>particular case, we can answer design-oriented questions. One question
  is, what if I want to sharpen the peak of this low-pass filter?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Answer: have <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> approach 1. Can't get too close -- real-world has
    noise. Also, in trouble if <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> jumps onto or outside of the unit
    circle. Algebraic argument available, as well.</p>
<p>: move <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> toward the unit circle (but still keep it inside)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Can I make a high-pass filter out of this?</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes. Set <mathjax>$-1 &lt; \alpha &lt; 0$</mathjax>.
    : take <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> to <mathjax>$-1 &lt; \alpha &lt; 0$</mathjax></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By taking <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> to be negative, we have the equivalent of a phase
    shift by <mathjax>$\pi$</mathjax>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Sharper high-pass filter?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Bring <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> closer to -1.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What if we want the filter to peak @ an arbitrary frequency, say</h1>
<p><mathjax>$\omega_0$</mathjax> = <mathjax>$\pi/4$</mathjax>?</p>
<ul>
<li>Place <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax>  along the pole <mathjax>$\theta = \omega_0$</mathjax>.</li>
</ul>
<p><mathjax>$1/(1-\abs{\alpha})$</mathjax></p>
<p>observation: this filter is a complex filter (i.e. one whose impulse
  response <mathjax>$h(n)$</mathjax> is complex valued). This has its uses but is not always
  desirable.</p>
<p><mathjax>$h(n) = \alpha^n u(n) = R^n e^{i\omega_0n}$</mathjax></p>
<p><mathjax>$g(n) = h(n)e^{i\omega_0n} \implies G(\omega) = H(\omega -\omega _0)$</mathjax></p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>LCCDE: linear constant coefficient difference equation</p>
<p><mathjax>$y(n) = \alpha y(n-N) + x(n)$</mathjax>. N is a positive integer, not necessarily 1.
<mathjax>$y(-N) = ... = y(n) = 0$</mathjax></p>
<p><mathjax>$(\abs{\alpha} &lt; 1)$</mathjax></p>
<p><mathjax>$$h_{N}(n) = \alpha h_{N}(n-N) + \delta(n) = !(n % N) &amp;&amp; \alpha^{n/N}.
H_{N}(\omega)\\ = \sum_{k=0}^\infty\alpha^{k}e^{-i\omega Nk}
  \sum(\alpha e^{-i\omega N})^k = 1/(1-\alpha e^{-i\omega N})
\\ \abs{H_{N}(\omega)} = \abs{e^{i\omega N}/(e^{i\omega N} - \alpha)}
$$</mathjax></p>
<p>Use <mathjax>$\omega \equiv \omega N$</mathjax>, then use a change of variables (after
plotting) to recover the initial basis and label axes and whatnot.</p>
<p>Or use some arbitrary argument that it's a contracted version by going back
to <mathjax>$H(\omega)$</mathjax>. Roughly equivalent either way.</p>
<p>Graph of <mathjax>$\abs{H(2\omega)}$</mathjax>, for <mathjax>$0&lt;\alpha &lt;1$</mathjax>.</p>

<p>Homework should be out today. Yes, there are homeworks in this class.</p>
<p>analog system procedure for figuring out frequency response of
systems.</p>
<p>Fourier analysis today. Some of this will be review, but we'll dive
more deeply into the linear algebra in this class.</p>
<p>Roadmap:
 * Fourier Analysis
   "A way of decomposing signals into their constituent frequencies.
   Kind of like the way a prism splits light into its components.
   Fourier analysis gives us the tools we need to analyze signals."
   + Periodic [ in time domain. ]
     - Discrete time, discrete time Fourier series.
     - Continuous time, continuous time Fourier series.
   + Aperiodic
     - Discrete-time Fourier transform.
     - Continuous-time Fourier transform
   We can put blocks around these. Discrete-time signals are periodic
   in the frequency domain.</p>
<p>Before I do that, I want to review an abstraction that we use for
   signals (and the way we look at signals) as vectors.</p>
<h1>Periodic DT Signals</h1>
<p><mathjax>$x(n+p) = x(n) \forall n \exists p \in \{1,2,3,4,...\}$</mathjax></p>
<p>p is called the period of x. The smallest p for which this is true is
called the fundamental period.</p>
<p>With discrete-time signals that are periodic, you always have to find out
the period before you can talk about frequencies. <mathjax>$\omega_0\equiv2\pi/p$</mathjax> is
the fundamental frequency.</p>
<p>Let's say we have a signal defined as ...4/2/4/2/4/2...</p>
<p>We can abstract and represent this signal as a cartesian vector. A
euclidean vector. Namely, I can go to p-space and draw <mathjax>$\mathbf{x}$</mathjax>. I
basically take the values in that one period and stack them
up. <mathjax>$x=[4, 2]$</mathjax>. I can ask you a couple of questions: what the
representation of this vector is in terms of two canonical vectors:
<mathjax>$\psi_0=[1,0]$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$\psi_1=[0,1]$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\ket{x} = 4\ket{\psi_0} +
2\ket{\psi_1}$</mathjax>. We do this via projection. Or a change of basis. <mathjax>$[4,2] =
4[1,0] + 2[0,1]$</mathjax>. Inner products and stuff. <mathjax>$\braket{x}{\psi_0} +
\braket{x}{\psi_1}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p><mathjax>$\braket{x}{\psi_0} = (x_0\psi_0 + x_1\psi_1)^T\psi_0 = x_0(\psi_0)^T\psi_0
+ x_1(\psi_1)^T\psi_0 = x_0\psi_0 + 0$</mathjax>.</p>
<p><mathjax>$x^T\psi_0 = x_0\psi_0^T\psi_0$</mathjax></p>
<p><mathjax>$x_0 = x^T\psi_0/(\psi_0^T\psi_0)$</mathjax></p>
<p>Just use inner product with normalized basis vectors.</p>
<p>In this case, it was easy to find out what the coefficients were. I can
repose the question by changing the <mathjax>$\psi_k$</mathjax>. I'm going to rotate the basis.</p>
<p>Basically, non-normalized sign basis. [3, 1].</p>
<p>[ talk about how we only need two orthogonal vectors, since our fundamental
  period is 2. Don't need a third vector. ]</p>
<p>Now, there's something special about these two frequencies we found.</p>
<p>Harmonics. Integer multiples of the fundamentals. Number of terms equals
period. Certainly what this toy example is indicating.</p>
<p>Now the question is, how do we find these coefficients? Oh wait, we've
already solved that problem.</p>
<h1>INTERMISSION</h1>
<p>I'm going to recast what we just did in matrix-vector form. We said that x
as a vector can be represented as a linear combination of <mathjax>$\psi_0$</mathjax> and
<mathjax>$\psi_1$</mathjax>. I chose the period over the interval 0 to 1. I can do the same
thing with <mathjax>$\psi_0$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$\psi_1$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>This is just the matrix for the FT. I have <mathjax>$x = x_0\psi_0 + x_1\psi_1 =
F[x_0,x_1]$</mathjax>, where <mathjax>$F = \begin{bmatrix}1&amp;1\\1&amp;-1\end{bmatrix} =
[\psi_0, \psi_1]$</mathjax>. This is a 2x2 matrix.</p>
<p>I can write this as <mathjax>$x = \Psi X$</mathjax>. Solve for X: left-multiply by inverse Fourier
transform. <mathjax>$F^{-1} = \frac{1}{n}F^\dagger$</mathjax>.</p>
<h1>INTERMISSION</h1>
<p>Once you have complex numbers, you can no longer use the dot product. We
now need the inner product. <mathjax>$\braket{a}{b} = a(T)b^*$</mathjax>. Fails otherwise, since
<mathjax>$\braket{x}{x} \neq \abs{x}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p><mathjax>$x$</mathjax> is <mathjax>$p$</mathjax>-periodic.</p>
<p><mathjax>$\vec{x} = [x(0), ... , x(p-1)]$</mathjax>. I have <mathjax>$\psi_k \perp \psi_l$</mathjax>, where
<mathjax>$b\braket{\psi_k}{\psi_l} = p\cdot\delta_{kl}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Proof of orthogonality of <mathjax>$\psi_k$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$\psi_l$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$k \neq l$</mathjax>. Geometric sum,
not very interesting.</p>
<p><mathjax>$x$</mathjax> is the linear combination of our <mathjax>$\psi_k$</mathjax>.</p>
<p><mathjax>$\braket{x}{\psi_l} = X_l\braket{\psi_l}{\psi_l} \implies X_l =
\frac{1}{p} \braket{x}{\psi_l}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>synthesis equation, analysis equation:</p>
<p><mathjax>$x(n) = \sum X_k e^{ik\omega_0n}$</mathjax>
<mathjax>$X(n) = \sum x_k e^{-ik\omega_0n}$</mathjax></p>

<h1>DTFS</h1>
<p><mathjax>$x(n) = \sum X_k e^{ik\omega_0n}$</mathjax>. The complex exponentials form a basis
for <mathjax>$\mathbb{C}^2$</mathjax>. The way we define inner products for signals is exactly
as you'd imagine. <mathjax>$\sum \psi_k(n) \psi^*_l(n)$</mathjax>. Frequency periodicity:
<mathjax>$\psi_{k+p} \equiv \psi_k$</mathjax>. Only in discrete-time periodic case are our
functions guaranteed to be both periodic in time as well as frequency.</p>

<p>Evidently there will be a quiz on Tue, since pset is due on Wed.</p>
<p>Consider what it means to send discrete-time periodic signals through

<h2>February 7, 2012.</h2>
<p>CTFS:</p>
<p>periodic if <mathjax>$x(t+p) = x(t) \exists p \in R$</mathjax>. Smallest positive <mathjax>$p$</mathjax> is
called the fundamental period. Fundamental frequency <mathjax>$\omega_0 \equiv
\frac{2\pi}{p}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Can also write <mathjax>$p = 2\pi/\omega_0$</mathjax>. In discrete-time, writing it this way
was dangerous, since depending on <mathjax>$\omega_0$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$p$</mathjax> may or may not be an integer.</p>
<p>For discrete-time signals, the constant signal was periodic with <mathjax>$p=1$</mathjax>.
<mathjax>$x(t) = 1 \forall t \in Z$</mathjax>?</p>
<p>What about the signal <mathjax>$x(t) = 1 \forall t \in R$</mathjax>? The fundamental period is
undefined: any <mathjax>$p&gt;0$</mathjax> can serve as a period.</p>
<p>So there are subtleties in each story. In the discrete-time story, there
were some sinusoids that looked periodic but weren't, and the constant
signal has no fundamental period in continuous-time.</p>
<p>We're going to jump immediately into the Fourier series. He said you can
decompose any continuous signal as a linear combination of complex
exponentials that are related to each other by virtue of being at
frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental period.</p>
<p><mathjax>$x(t) = \sum X_k e^{ik\omega_0t} = \sum X_k\psi_k$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>We know the procedure for finding the kth coefficient. Before we go there,
there's something you ought to pay attention to in this expression. When I
draw a typical periodic signal, when I look at one period, how many points
do I have? Uncountably infinite. Also range is potentially a set of
uncountably many values. So this is a bold claim: we can represent these
with a countable number of eigenfunctions.</p>
<p>Unlike the discrete-time story, this equality will not always be a
pointwise equality. There are different gradations of convergence. Whenever
you have an infinite sum, you have to worry about convergence in the back
of your head. For well-behaved signals, the left and the right converge,
and this is true for every t. The less well-behaved signals will no longer
hold pointwise. Strange things happen, e.g. Gibbs phenomenon.</p>
<p>You'll have a reasonable understanding of Fourier series. We're not going
to worry too much about convergence in this class. The only time it doesn't
arise is in the discrete-time Fourier series.</p>
<p>Claim: Fourier analysis works. One path we can take is for you to take my
word for it. Or we could prove it. Since last time was hilarious, we're
going to take this for granted, for now. Assume orthogonality of <mathjax>$\psi_k$</mathjax>
for some definition of the inner product. <mathjax>$\psi_k = \exp(ik\omega_0 t)$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>I am now going to determine <mathjax>$X_l$</mathjax>. Take the inner product of <mathjax>$x$</mathjax> with
<mathjax>$\psi_l$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>The procedure is exactly the same. We're just swapping out our definition
of inner product. Exploit the orthogonality.</p>
<p>For discrete-time p-periodic signals, we defined the inner product as
<mathjax>$\braket{f}{g} = \sum fg^*$</mathjax>. Guess what the continuous-time inner product
is for <mathjax>$p$</mathjax>-periodic signal!</p>
<p>And if they're non-periodic, we'll do the same, but over all time.</p>
<p>Show that our eigenfunctions are orthogonal.</p>
<p>Synthesis equation: <mathjax>$x(t) = \sum X_k \exp(ik\omega_0 t)$</mathjax>
Analysis equation:  <mathjax>$X_k = (1/p)\int x_k\exp(-ik\omega_0 t)$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>How do I show that <mathjax>$\braket{\psi_k}{\psi_l} = 0 (k\neq l)$</mathjax>? Just evaluate
the integral. We get an exponential with period p, integrated over a period
p? Looks like 0 to me.</p>
<p>Example: <mathjax>$X(t) = cos(\pi t/3)$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$(\exp(i\pi t/3) + \exp(-i\pi
t/3))/2$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\psi_1 = \psi_{-1} = \frac{1}{2}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p><mathjax>$q(t) = \sum\delta(t-\ell p) = \sum Q_k \exp(ik\omega_0t)$</mathjax>
<mathjax>$\delta(t) = \deriv{u(t)}{t}$</mathjax></p>
<p>Poisson's identity. <mathjax>$\sum\delta(t-\ell p) = \frac{1}{p}\sum\exp(ik\omega_0t)$</mathjax></p>
<p><mathjax>$R_k = \frac{1}{p}\int r(k)\exp(-ik\omega_0t) = \frac{1}{p}$</mathjax> if <mathjax>$k=0$</mathjax> else
<mathjax>$\frac{\sin(k\omega_0\Delta/2)}{pk\pi\Delta/2}$</mathjax></p>
<p>What happens if I want to approximate a signal that has finite energy? What
should the coefficients <mathjax>$\alpha_k$</mathjax> be?</p>

<h1>Discrete-time Fourier transform</h1>
<p>Discrete aperiodic signals. The DTFT can also handle discrete-time periodic
signals, provided that we make use of Dirac deltas in the frequency
domain. You all should remember that the frequency response of a
discrete-time LTI system <mathjax>$H(\omega) = \sum h(\ell)\exp^{-i\omega\ell}$</mathjax>
[DTFT analysis equation]. It turns out this is the DTFT of the impulse
response.</p>
<p>How to go from frequency domain to time domain, i.e. how to derive impulse
response from frequency response.</p>
<p>Our goal is to determine h from H. That's what we want to do. And I'm going
to do this in two ways, both of which rely on things we've already done. So
there's nothing new that I'm going to go through.</p>
<p>Recall: With discrete LTI systems: frequency response has fundamental
period <mathjax>$2\pi$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$H(\omega+2\pi)=H(\omega)$</mathjax>. We already possess the
mathematical machinery to handle periodic continuous variables (i.e. we've
seen this in the CTFS). Then, our continuous variable was time. Now, it's
frequency.</p>
<p>Recall CTFS. <mathjax>$x(t)$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$p$</mathjax>: fundamental period. <mathjax>$\omega_0 = \frac{2\pi}{p}$</mathjax>:
fundamental frequency. We said we can express x as a linear combination of
complex exponentials that are harmonics (integer multiples) of the
fundamental frequency. We had an expression for these. <mathjax>$X_k =
\frac{1}{p}\int x(t)e^{-ik\omega t}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>I'm going to draw parallels now with the current scenario: <mathjax>$x\to
H$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$t\to\omega$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$p\to2\pi$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\omega_0=\frac{2\pi}{p}\to\Omega_0 =
\frac{2\pi}{2\pi}=1$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\therefore X_k = h(-k)$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Let <mathjax>$k\equiv-\ell$</mathjax> in equation (<mathjax>$\star$</mathjax>). <mathjax>$H(\omega)=\sum
h(-k)e^{ik\Omega_0\omega}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Our coefficients are the <mathjax>$h(-k) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\avg{2\pi}} H(\omega)
e^{-ik\omega} d\omega$</mathjax>. This is exactly parallel to the previous
expression.</p>
<p><mathjax>$h(\ell) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int H(\omega)e^{i\ell\omega}d\omega$</mathjax>. Synthesis
equation.</p>
<p>DTFT equations:
<mathjax>$H(\omega) = \sum h(n)e^{-i\omega n}$</mathjax>.
<mathjax>$h(n) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int H(\omega)e^{i\omega n}d\omega$</mathjax>.</p>
<p><mathjax>$h(n) = \int \frac{d\omega H(\omega)}{2\pi}e^{i\omega n}$</mathjax>. Linear combination of
complex exponentials. <mathjax>$H(\omega)$</mathjax> is a measure of the contribution of
frequency <mathjax>$\omega$</mathjax> to the function <mathjax>$h$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>For now, we're working with the universe of functions of the continuous
variable <mathjax>$\omega$</mathjax> which happen to be periodic with period <mathjax>$2\pi$</mathjax>.</p>

<h2>February 16, 2012.</h2>
<h2>Discrete-Time Fourier Transform: continued</h2>
<p>Recall the ideal low-pass filter. In time-domain, it had some
discontinuities. In freq domain, it was NOT absolutely summable. However,
it is square-summable. We have names for signals that behave in these
particular ways.</p>
<p><mathjax>$\ell_1$</mathjax> signals: absolutely summable. <mathjax>$\sum \abs{x(n)} &lt; \infty$</mathjax> (abuse of
notation, but useful at that).</p>
<p><mathjax>$\ell_2$</mathjax> signals: Square-summable. <mathjax>$\sum \abs{x(n)}^2 &lt; \infty$</mathjax>. Finite
energy.</p>
<p>For discrete-time, if a signal is <mathjax>$\ell_1$</mathjax>, it is <mathjax>$\ell_2$</mathjax>. Converse not
true.</p>
<p><mathjax>$\sum\abs{h(n)} = \sum_{n=0 \to \infty} \abs{\alpha}^n =
\frac{1}{1-\abs{\alpha}} &lt; \infty$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$h \in \ell_1 \implies$</mathjax> finite
<mathjax>$\abs{H(\omega)}$</mathjax> and smooth.</p>
<p>If <mathjax>$x \notin \ell_1$</mathjax> but <mathjax>$x \in \ell_2$</mathjax>, you run into a bit of a problem:
cannot use analysis equation, since summation will not converge. But we can
define the Fourier transform in that case to be the limit as <mathjax>$N \to \infty$</mathjax>
of <mathjax>$\sum_{-N \to N} x(n)e^{-i\omega n}$</mathjax>. DTFTs are continuous (not
necessarily smooth / infinitely differentiable).</p>
<p>Turns out we get convergence in energy of the two signals. It's just for
you to bear in mind, since you have an infinite sum. The most well-behaved
functions are <mathjax>$\ell_1$</mathjax>. They have nice DTFTs. Next level up in terms of
misbehavior is <mathjax>$\ell_2$</mathjax>. Fourier transforms cannot be obtained through
analysis equation, but can be reverse-engineered or otherwise. DTFTs have
discontinuities.</p>
<p>We have yet another level up in terms of misbehavior. We have signals of
"slow growth". (zero growth) Examples: <mathjax>$x(n) = 1$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$x(n) = n$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$x(n) =
e^{i\omega_0 n}$</mathjax>. Basically, these are signals that grow no faster than
polynomially in time. (and signals that neither grow nor decay). Notice
these signals <mathjax>$\cap (\ell_1 \cup \ell_2) = null$</mathjax>. Cannot use analysis
equation, but can use synthesis equation. And their DTFTs have Dirac
deltas.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><mathjax>$x(n) = e^{i\omega_0n} X(\omega)$</mathjax>? <mathjax>$\alpha\delta(\omega-\omega_0$</mathjax>). Strictly
speaking, we'd have to write the spectrum as a sum: we have a delta every
<mathjax>$2\pi$</mathjax>, starting at <mathjax>$\omega_0$</mathjax>. But that's not particularly interesting,
since that looks messy. I'm just interested in the interval here. As long
as we know that it's <mathjax>$2\pi$</mathjax>-periodic.</p>
<p>To get our <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax>, we can and will use our synthesis equation:
<mathjax>$\frac{\alpha}{2\pi}\int \delta(\omega-\omega_0 e^{i\omega
n}d\omega$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\frac{\alpha}{2\pi} e^{i\omega_0n} = e^{i\omega_0n} \implies
\alpha \equiv 2\pi$</mathjax>.</p>
<p><mathjax>$\pi\delta(\omega-\omega_0) + \pi\delta(\omega+\omega_0)$</mathjax> (<mathjax>$2\pi$</mathjax>-periodic,
again)</p>
<p>For signals that belong to none of the previous categories, we have to
learn a new transform -- Z-transform! Z-transform! Coming in March, to
theaters near you.</p>
<p>Why do <mathjax>$\ell_1$</mathjax> signals have finite DTFTs?</p>
<p>triangle inequality, following directly from the synthesis equation.</p>
<h1>INTERMISSION</h1>
<h2>DTFT Properties</h2>
<h1>Time-shifting</h1>
<p>If I have a signal that's Fourier-transformed? What do I get in the
frequency domain if I shift the original signal?</p>
<p>We get a phase shift: if we shift x(n) by N, our new <mathjax>$X(\omega)$</mathjax> is
multiplied by <mathjax>$e^{-i\omega N}$</mathjax>.</p>
<h2>Example / curveball</h2>
<p><mathjax>$H(\omega) = e^{-i\omega/2}4$</mathjax>
which yields <mathjax>$h(n)= \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{\pi}(n-\frac{1}{2})$</mathjax></p>
<p>Remember: convolution and multiplication are duals over the time and
frequency domains.</p>
<p>Not too long from now, we are going to start studying the sampling
theorem. One way to consider this as a half-delayed sample of X is to think
of X as having samples. We map this to a sequence of samples in continuous
time, split apart by T seconds (sampling period). Interpolation scheme that
we'll learn about, etc. I can shift to the left or right by an arbitrary
amount. So in continuous time, I take this signal and I shift it to the
right by T/2 seconds. So I take whatever this was, take samples spaced T
apart, then convert it back into Kr\"onecker deltas.</p>
<p>This filter is called, for the reason described, a half-sample delay. You
essentially have to interpolate between the frequencies in discrete time
and sample the halfway points.</p>
<p>What happens if I multiply in the time domain by a complex exponential
(modulation)? The frequency domain is convolved with said exponential.</p>
<p>Using the analysis equation,we have <mathjax>$X(\omega) = \sum x(n) e^{i (\omega -
\omega_0) n} = X(\omega-\omega_0)$</mathjax>.</p>
<h1>Multiplying the time domain by <mathjax>$e^{i\omega_0}$</mathjax> results in a frequency shift.</h1>
<p>Multiplying by a complex exponential yields a shift in the other domain.</p>
<p>There is one property that is distinct, and that is the modulation
property (multiplication property).</p>
<p><mathjax>$q(n) = x(n)y(n) \iff Q(\omega)$</mathjax>. Not an ordinary convolution.</p>
<p><mathjax>$Q(\omega) = \sum x(n)y(n)e^{-i\omega n}$</mathjax></p>
<p>In particular, for <mathjax>$x(n)$</mathjax>, use synthesis equation to replace <mathjax>$x(n)$</mathjax> with
<mathjax>$X(\xi)$</mathjax> (where <mathjax>$\xi$</mathjax> is a dummy variable).</p>
<p><mathjax>$$
Q(\omega) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sum_n\int_\avg{2\pi}
X(\xi)e^{i\xi n}y(n)d\xi e^{-i\omega n}.
= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_\avg{2\pi}d\xi X(\xi)\sum_n e^{-i(\omega-\xi)n}y(n)d\xi
= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_\avg{2\pi}d\xi X(\xi)Y(\omega-\lambda)
$$</mathjax></p>
<p>What's special about this? It's only over a value of <mathjax>$2\pi$</mathjax>. This is a very
special kind of convolution. We call this a circular convolution of <mathjax>$x$</mathjax> and
<mathjax>$y$</mathjax>. So <mathjax>$x(n)y(n) \iff \frac{1}{2\pi} (X*Y)(\omega)$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Think of two functions plotted in terms of <mathjax>$\lambda$</mathjax>. One function, let's
say, is a square pulse wave thingy.</p>
<p>easy way of carrying out circular convolution: take one of the two
functions, keep one replica (e.g. the one from <mathjax>$-\pi$</mathjax> to <mathjax>$\pi$</mathjax>), and then
do a regular convolution with the other function. advice: choose the
flipped + shifted signal for elimination of replicas.</p>

<p>Inspection method? It looks like it's <mathjax>$2\pi h^2(n) = \frac{2B^2}{\pi

<p>Now we are desperate to have <mathjax>$\infint e^{i\omega t}d\omega =

<p>Constructively interfere at <mathjax>$t = 0$</mathjax>, but destructively interfere at <mathjax>$t \neq

<h2>INTERMISSION</h2>
<h2>Amplitude modulation</h2>
<p>I'm going to start what looks like a new phase of this course, but it's
hardly anything new and unpredictable. If you understand the CTFT and its
fundamental properties (what we've talked about so far), you should have no
problem understanding amplitude modulation.</p>
<p>One of the things you've experienced by now is that the atmosphere is quite
unforgiving to audible frequencies. Your voice only transmits over some
short distance.</p>
<p>Obvious solution is to shift spectrum to a much higher frequency range. The
way we do it is to multiply by either a complex exponential or a
sine/cosine (called a carrier signal). Carries signal of interest. So
<mathjax>$Y(\omega) = \frac{1}{2\pi}(X * C)(\omega) = X(\omega - \omega_0)$</mathjax>. What
happens is that <mathjax>$\omega_0$</mathjax> is usually large enough to make transmission
through the atmosphere possible.</p>
<p>Ignoring all degradation going through the atmosphere, to retrieve the
original signal, multiply by the negative carrier frequency (complex
exponential). Frequencies about zero: baseband frequencies. Shifted
spectrum of received signal back to baseband.</p>
<p>aliasing; completely garbles signal.</p>
<p>Apply low-pass filter at end to capture baseband spectrum. Scale by two to
recover original signal, complete with amplitude.</p>
<p>Final observations: we first of all made an assumption that the received
signal is the same as the transmitted signal. Whole area of communication
theory that deals with deterioration. Other assumption is that the
oscillator at the receiver that can generate the exact same frequency as
the transmitter oscillator and at the same phase.</p>

is constant and not time-varying)</p>
<h2>Thoughts:</h2>
<p>If the phase is off by <mathjax>$\pi/2$</mathjax>, then you lose your signal entirely. <mathjax>$r(t) =
\frac{1}{2}\cos(\theta)x(t) + \frac{1}{2} x(t)\cos(2\omega_0t +
\theta)$</mathjax>. If <mathjax>$\theta$</mathjax> is relatively small (compared to <mathjax>$\pi/2$</mathjax>), then we
are safe, since we have our original signal. However, we lose our signal
as <mathjax>$\cos\theta\to0$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Note:
MT2 date: Tues, 13 Mar 2012.</p>
<p>Also: when <mathjax>$\theta=0$</mathjax>, this is referred to synchronous demodulation
(transmitter and receiver in sync)</p>
<p>Instead of sending <mathjax>$y(t)$</mathjax> into a low-pass filter, what we do is send it
through the diode parallel RC circuit. This is one way to do asynchronous
demodulation. This is technically cheating, since we assume that our signal
is entirely positive. However, we can simply apply a DC offset if we know
the bounds on our values.</p>
<p>Suppose <mathjax>$|x(t)| \le A \forall t$</mathjax>. Then, transmit <mathjax>$\hat{x}(t) \equiv x(t) +
A$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Why is this method of transmitting <mathjax>$\hat{x}(t)$</mathjax> called AM with large
carrier? We're actually also transmitting the carrier: <mathjax>$\hat{x}(t)
\cos(\omega_0 t) = x(t)\cos(\omega_0 t) =A\cos(\omega_0 t)$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>If <mathjax>$\abs{x(t)} \le K$</mathjax>, we want <mathjax>$K &lt; A$</mathjax>. In fact, <mathjax>$\frac{K}{A}$</mathjax> is referred
to as the percent modulation or modulation index.</p>
<p>One thing you should know is that there is redundancy in information double
side-band suppressed carrier.</p>

<p>Each player is allocated a piece of real estate along the frequency axis.</p>

<h1>Sampling of CT Signals</h1>
<p>Now we have to differentiate between frequency in radians per second
(<mathjax>$\omega$</mathjax>), and frequency in radians per sample (<mathjax>$\Omega$</mathjax>). Our sampling
interval we will represent with <mathjax>$T_s$</mathjax>, our sampling period.</p>
<p>There are associated with these boundary blocks (<mathjax>$C \to D$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$D \to C$</mathjax>)
periods. <mathjax>$T_r$</mathjax> : reconstruction period. <mathjax>$T_r$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$T_s$</mathjax> may or may not be
the same.</p>
<p>The new part really is sampling theory.</p>
<p>So let's begin.</p>
<p>Let's say I have a continuous-time signal <mathjax>$x_c(t)$</mathjax>. We sample
periodically. <mathjax>$x_d(0)=x_c(0)$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$x_d(1)=x_c(T_s)$</mathjax>. Basically,
<mathjax>$x_d(n)=x_c(nT_s)$</mathjax>. A basic question is whether or not it is possible to
reconstruct the original signal? In general, the answer is no.</p>
<p>There must be (we hope so, at least) a set of conditions that guarantees
recoverability. These actually happen to be sufficient conditions. That is
the whole subject of the Sampling theorem, which we will develop.</p>
<p>So let me open up this first box, the process of sampling. We can model the
process of sampling this signal as one that involves multiplying the
original input signal by an impulse train, where the impulses are separated
<mathjax>$T_s$</mathjax> second apart. Remember: multiplying a function that is locally
continuous with an impulse is equivalent to rescaling the impulse.</p>
<p>Once you extract <mathjax>$x_q$</mathjax>, there's a block we're not going to worry about that
converts Dirac deltas to Kr\"onecker deltas. Believe it or not, there is
nothing new here.</p>
<p>What happens to the spectrum of <mathjax>$x_c$</mathjax> as it is multiplied by the impulse
train?</p>
<p>Our fundamental frequency of this signal is <mathjax>$\frac{2\pi}{T_s}$</mathjax>. It's also
called, in this context, our sampling frequency.</p>
<p>Considering the DTFT of periodic signals, we have a bunch of uniform
impulses separated by <mathjax>$\omega_s$</mathjax>, and each of them has strength
<mathjax>$\omega_2$</mathjax>. What happens when <mathjax>$T_s$</mathjax> gets smaller? The sampling frequency
increases, and so we have stronger (and more separated) impulses as our
spectrum.</p>
<p>Our CTFT is simply <mathjax>$2\pi\sum_k Q_k\delta(\omega-k\omega_s)$</mathjax>. Multiplication
in the time domain is convolution in the frequency domain, so we can
consider the triangles.</p>
<p>So what happens? In order for these triangles to be recoverable, we need <mathjax>$2A
\le \omega_s$</mathjax>, or <mathjax>$A \le \frac{\omega_s}{2}$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\omega_s$</mathjax> must be large
enough that adjacent triangles do not overlap (and this is, indeed, the
crux of the sampling theorem) -- in this case, we can certainly recover our
original signal by applying a low-pass filter. </p>
<p>The low-pass filtering is an interpolation operation -- we're interpolating
between adjacent values of the signal.</p>
<p>(explanation: You've got your samplings of the signal, so we've actually
got a set of impulses. We're applying a low-pass filter on this and filling
in the missing portions of the signal. Remember that our ideal low-pass
filter is the sinc, and so we're taking the linear combination of a
countably infinite set of sincs)</p>
<h1>Whittaker-Nyquist-Kotelnikov-Shannon Sampling Theorem</h1>
<p>(1915, 1928, 1933, 1949)</p>
<p>Most frequently known as the Shannon Sampling theorem. This is the set of
sufficient conditions for recovering a signal from a sequence of samples.</p>
<ul>
<li><mathjax>$x_c$</mathjax> is band limited. Namely, <mathjax>$\abs{X_c(\omega)} = 0 (\abs{\omega} &gt;
   A)$</mathjax>.</li>
<li>Sampling rate <mathjax>$\omega_s$</mathjax> is large enough such that <mathjax>$2A \le \omega_s$</mathjax></li>
</ul>
<p>There is no universal definition of bandwidth. In some circles, the highest
frequency A is called the bandwidth. In other circles, the frequency's
footprint 2A is called the bandwidth. Does not really matter.</p>
<p>As mentioned, nothing mentioned today is new; we've just used very basic
properties of the CTFT of periodic signals and the convolution property.</p>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>What if <mathjax>$\omega_s &lt; 2A$</mathjax>? (by the way, <mathjax>$2A$</mathjax> is called the Nyquist
rate). There has been a big push lately. Look up sub-Nyquist in a group of
papers. There are many people trying to figure out how to sample at a
lower-than-Nyquist rate.</p>
<p>So what happens if <mathjax>$\omega_s = 2A$</mathjax>? Our triangles are tangent. In the ideal
case, this is still acceptable, but it is impossible to build an ideal
low-pass filter, so it doesn't actually matter.</p>
<p>Oversampling: you exceed the Nyquist rate by a certain amount to
compensate. Past a certain amount of oversampling, it doesn't really mean
anything.</p>
<p>If <mathjax>$\omega_s &lt; 2A$</mathjax>, our triangles overlap, and so the spectrum is
significantly different.</p>
<p>Higher frequencies get folded into lower frequencies. This is called
aliasing: the artifact of folding of higher frequencies into lower
frequencies. Once you have that, you have irrecoverably lost your original
signal.</p>
<p>In image processing, we have anti-aliasing (our next topic).</p>
<p>Notice that if the signal is band-limited, we can make <mathjax>$\omega_s$</mathjax> large
enough such that we do not get overlap. If <mathjax>$x_c$</mathjax> is <strong>not</strong> band-limited,
then no matter how high we make <mathjax>$\omega_s$</mathjax>, we're going to have some
overlap. There's one thing we can do in that case, but that's a
compromise. We call this:</p>
<h2>Anti-aliasing</h2>
<p>The idea is we discard frequencies above a certain value. With aliasing, the frequency
region is distorted, which is reflected everywhere in the time domain. This
is generally not good, unless it's really small and you can ignore it.</p>
<p>Anti-alias filtering is a preprocessing stage. <mathjax>$x_c(t) \to LPF \to
q(t)$</mathjax>. Namely, apply a low-pass filter (with cutoffs @ <mathjax>$-\frac{\omega_s}
{2}$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$\frac{\omega_s}{2}$</mathjax>) before sampling. We eliminate the aliasing we
know will happen (in the event that we don't do this).</p>
<p>The result is that you don't lose quite as high of frequencies. There is no
more aliasing.</p>
<p>So why anti-alias first instead of allowing it to alias, if you lose
information either way?</p>
<ul>
<li>Anti-aliasing allows for the preservation of more of the original
   signal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The set of signals that does not produce aliasing with a fixed <mathjax>$\omega_s$</mathjax>
are those that are band-limited by <mathjax>$\left(-\frac{\omega_s}{2},\frac{\omega_s}
{2}\right)$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>(talk about Parseval's theorem)</p>
<h2>Carriage-wheel effect</h2>
<p>Aliasing is what causes the phenomenon that some of you may have noticed:
when on the highway, and you stare at the wheels of the car passing by you,
and they seem to be moving much slower in the opposite direction. Used to
show up at PhD qualifying exams at MIT. You may also find this described as
the carriage-wheel effect. Since the frame rate of old movies was 24 frames
per second, the wheels looked to be moving backward.</p>
<p>Mark a point on the unit circle. I strobe this wheel at a rate <mathjax>$\omega_s$</mathjax>
(strobing it is like sampling it). So I've got this strobe gun with a
sampling rate of <mathjax>$\omega_s$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\omega_s$</mathjax> happens to be <mathjax>$\frac{3}{2}
\omega_0$</mathjax> (so not exceeding the Nyquist rate). If I sample exactly at
<mathjax>$\omega_0$</mathjax>, the point looks stationary. So the only way to capture the
motion properly is to capture at <mathjax>$2\omega_0$</mathjax> and higher. But I'm not doing
that.</p>
<p>Its spectrum is a single Dirac impulse of strength <mathjax>$2\pi$</mathjax> centered at
<mathjax>$\omega_0$</mathjax>. The sampling signal <mathjax>$Q(\omega)$</mathjax> will have an impulse train
separated by <mathjax>$\omega_s$</mathjax>. When we convolve this and apply a low-pass filter,
we have just one remaining frequency at <mathjax>$\omega_0-\omega_s = -\frac
{\omega_0}{2}$</mathjax>.</p>
<h1>EE 120: Signals and Systems</h1>
<h2>March 6, 2012.</h2>
<h1>Sampling Cont'd</h1>
<p>We are still in the first of three blocks (where we take a continuous-time
signal and create a discrete-time signal).</p>
<p>This end-to-end system is effectively a continuous-time system.</p>
<p>This kind of processing we refer to (for obvious reasons) as discrete-time
processing of continuous-time signals. The opposite is also possible, where
you start out with a discrete-time signal, process in continuous-time, and
spit out a discrete-time signal.</p>
<p>Last time, we opened up the first box (<mathjax>$C \to D$</mathjax>). We didn't even talk
about the entire box -- there's still some stuff to discuss.</p>
<p>So, consider an impulse train. We then take this through a Dirac <mathjax>$\to$</mathjax>
Kr\"onecker block to produce <mathjax>$x_d(n)$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Question: How is <mathjax>$X_q(\omega)$</mathjax> related to <mathjax>$X_d(\Omega)$</mathjax>?</p>
<p>etc, work with moving around between coords.</p>
<p>All of this assumes that there has been no aliasing. For us to have had no
aliasing, remember the Nyquist sampling theorem.</p>
<p>Considerations of LTI for <mathjax>$Y_c(\omega) \equiv X_c\parens{\frac{\omega
T_r}{T_s}}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>The only way your end-to-end system will have an LTI-equivalent is if you
fulfill the conditions of the Nyquist sampling theorem (no aliasing), and
your reconstruction period is the same as your sampling period.</p>
<p>Then you know that your output is equal <mathjax>$\frac{G}{T} H_d\parens{ \omega T}
X_c(\omega)$</mathjax>. The equivalent LTI filter is simply <mathjax>$\frac{G}{T} nH_d \parens{
\omega T}$</mathjax></p>

<h2>March 8, 2012.</h2>
<p>Spoke about sampling, impulse train, conditions under which signal can be
recovered -- if band-limited, and frequency high enough, we can recover
with a low-pass filter.</p>
<p>We drew the spectrum, and we showed that if we sampled fast enough, we
could recover the original signal.</p>
<p>What I want to do now is talk about what is going on in the time domain. I
am sending the nonuniform impulse train into some low-pass filter, and I
want to see what <mathjax>$r(t)$</mathjax> is. So the first thing I want you to do is tell me
what the impulse response of this filter is. <mathjax>$h(t) = \sinc\parens{ \frac{
\omega_s t}{2}}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>When you convolve the sinc with these impulses, what do you get? Notice the
alignment. Since <mathjax>$x_q(t) = \sum x_c(nT_s)\delta(t-nT_s)$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$r(t) = \sum x_c
(nT_s) h(t-nT_s)$</mathjax>. So let's draw this. (basic premise: interpolation;
further from center means impulse has weaker effect. Also, zero crossings
occur at locations of all other impulses. Scaling is strength of impulse.)
We're only going to get one signal. Only one will be obtained from this
interpolation scheme.</p>
<p>Remember, <mathjax>$\sinc \alpha = \frac{\sin \pi \alpha}{\pi\alpha}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Thus the expression for <mathjax>$x_q(t)$</mathjax> can be rewritten as <mathjax>$\sum x_c (nT_s)
\sinc(\frac{\omega_s(t-nT_s)}{2\pi})$</mathjax>. This is a loaded
expression. Remember how when we started Fourier series, how we expand a
signal in terms of orthogonal basis functions? This is an orthogonal
expansion. The values of the signals at the sample points; these shifted
sincs are the orthogonal functions.</p>
<p>Now, if you look at your problem set, there are a couple of problems you
ought to pay attention to. One: Fourier transform preserves orthogonality,
i.e. if two signals are mutually orthogonal in the time domain, they're
mutually orthogonal in the frequency domain. You use that later to show
that these shifted sincs are orthogonal: you do not show this in the time
domain. That's where you use orthogonality-preserving property of the
continuous-time Fourier transform.</p>
<p>What does this mean? A band-limited signal <mathjax>$x$</mathjax> has an orthogonal expansion
in terms of shifted sincs. These are not arbitrary sincs: <mathjax>$T_s$</mathjax>, the
sampling period, enters this expression. It's very related to the bandwidth
of the original signal. Yet another context in which orthogonal expansions
show up.</p>
<p>You can essentially consider <mathjax>$h_0(t)$</mathjax> as the unshifted <mathjax>$\sinc (\frac
{\omega_s t}{2\pi}) = h(t)$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$h_n(t) = h_0(t - nT_s)$</mathjax>. These functions, we
claim, are mutually orthogonal. Namely, <mathjax>$\braket{h_k}{h_l} =
\delta_{kl}$</mathjax>. Here, you use Parseval's theorem, since you do not want to
integrate <mathjax>$\sinc^2$</mathjax>. Called band-limited interpolation, since you do not
get the original signal if either it wasn't band-limited, or you didn't
sample fast enough (which is where aliasing occurs).</p>
<h2>Another view of sampling as an orthogonal expansion:</h2>
<p>Another way to look at this is to start in the frequency domain, where I
have my spectrum of my signal. If you remember, Fourier series expansion is
not just useful for representing periodic signals, but also for
finite-duration functions (in this case, it's finite in frequency). You can
think of these phantom replications of this triangle. In other words, I can
create a periodic extension of this triangle, which is my <mathjax>$X_c(\omega)$</mathjax>, if
I create this periodic extension in such a way that these triangles touch
exactly.</p>
<p>I can write <mathjax>$X_c(\omega) \equiv \sum_{k\in \mathbb{Z}} X_k e^{ikT_s
\omega}$</mathjax>. We refer to <mathjax>$T_0 = 2\pi/2A$</mathjax> as our fundamental "frequency" of the
periodic extension of <mathjax>$X_c(\omega)$</mathjax>. (this has units of seconds, in
fact). This expression is only valid for the range <mathjax>$\abs{\omega} \le A$</mathjax>. It
is zero outside of said range.</p>
<p>You can do this for any finite-duration function, since this can be thought
of as one period of a periodic signal.</p>
<p>What I'm going to do is go back to the time-domain function using the CTFT
inverse formula. I'm looking at a band-limited function, so the integral
doesn't actually go from <mathjax>$-\infty$</mathjax> to <mathjax>$\infty$</mathjax>, but rather from <mathjax>$-A$</mathjax> to
<mathjax>$A$</mathjax>. And in this range, you know that <mathjax>$X_c$</mathjax> is equal to the Fourier series
expansion. So, exchanging the integral and the summation (as we do so very
often), and evaluating the integral, we get a linear combination of sinc
functions.</p>
<p>It turns out these coefficients are the values of the signal at the sampled
points. That isn't obvious yet. After some algebraic manipulations, we can
finally see that this whole thing is just <mathjax>$x_c(kT_s)$</mathjax>.</p>
<h1>EE 120: Signals and Systems</h1>
<h1><mathjax>$\mathcal{Z}$</mathjax> Transform</h1>
<p>Something we've been brushing under the carpet for a while is the set of
signals in which the Fourier transform is not defined.</p>
<p>So the Z transform is defined for discrete-time LTI systems. (discrete
analogue of the Laplace transform)</p>
<p>We know that the output is simply the convolution of the input with the
impulse response.</p>
<p>If we said that <mathjax>$h(n) = \alpha^n u(n)$</mathjax>, where <mathjax>$\abs{\alpha} &gt; 1$</mathjax>, then we
know that this signal has no frequency response. However, behavior can be
well-defined even though you can't say anything about it in the frequency
domain.</p>
<p>For instance: if x is of finite duration, then you have a finite number of
terms in the convolution corresponding to the output signal. You can thus
talk about the output of this system for such an impulse: convolution is
perfectly well-defined, and <mathjax>$y(n)$</mathjax> is finite for all n (and thus
well-defined).</p>
<p>Another situation: if x is right-sided (i.e. <mathjax>$x(n) = 0$</mathjax> for <mathjax>$n &lt; N$</mathjax> -- may
also have zero values to the right of <mathjax>$N$</mathjax>, but to the left, it is zero),
what happens?</p>
<p>Note that causal signals are a subset of right-sided signals. If n is
anything smaller than zero, you are looking at a right-sided but not
necessarily causal signal.</p>
<p>In the convolution of two right-sided signals (or two left-sided signals,
even!), finitely many terms contribute. Therefore in these cases (input and
impulse response) we can define our output anywhere (i.e. finite, but not
necessarily bounded).</p>
<p>Finally, if x is bounded and h is absolutely summable, then the system is
BIBO-stable -- <mathjax>$y$</mathjax> is finite, so it is also bounded.</p>
<p><mathjax>$\ell^\infty = \set{ x : \mathbb{Z} \mapsto \mathbb{C} : x(n) &lt; B_x &lt;
\infty}$</mathjax></p>
<p>Recall that <mathjax>$\ell^1 = \set{ h : \mathbb{Z} \mapsto \mathbb{C} : \sum
\abs{h(n)} &lt; B_x &lt; \infty }$</mathjax></p>
<p>For DTFT, we applied <mathjax>$e^{i\omega n}$</mathjax> to our system and observed that our
output was <mathjax>$H(\omega)e^{i\omega n}$</mathjax>, where we defined <mathjax>$H(\omega) = \sum_n
h(n)e^{-i\omega n}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>We're going to now relax the constraint that <mathjax>$\abs{e^{i\omega n}} = 1$</mathjax>,
i.e. <mathjax>$\omega \in \mathbb{R}$</mathjax>. Now let <mathjax>$x(n) = z^n \ (z \in \mathbb{C})$</mathjax>. So
if I apply this signal to the system, what am I going to get?</p>
<p><mathjax>$$
y(n) = \sum_m h(m)x(n-m) = \sum_m h(m)z^{n-m} = z^n\sum_m h(m)z^{-m}
\\ z^{-n} y(n) = \sum_m h(m)z^{-m} \equiv \hat{H}(z)
$$</mathjax></p>
<p>This is called the transfer function of the system.</p>
<p>The transfer function for us will either be the Z-transform (if
discrete-time) or the Laplace transform (if continuous-time). For now we're
stuck with the Z-transform.</p>
<p>Notice the similarity of the format of these expressions. The main
difference is that now, I'm allowed to veer away from the unit circle. This
is an infinite sum, so just as with the Fourier transform, we must worry
about convergence.</p>
<p>With Z transforms and Laplace transforms, we can't get away from
convergence. Associated with this sort of expression is what we call a
region of convergence (RoC). Basically, region in the complex plane for
which this sum converges.</p>
<p>Going to brush aside a lot of subtleties regarding convergence. <mathjax>$R_h$</mathjax> is
the region in the complex plane (i.e. the set of <mathjax>$z$</mathjax>) such that <mathjax>$\sum_m
\abs{h(m)z^{-m}} &lt; \infty$</mathjax>. If the kernel of this sum is absolutely
summable, we say that we are in the region of convergence. The values of
<mathjax>$z$</mathjax> for which this is true make up the region of convergence.</p>
<p>I can take any discrete-time function and talk about its Z-transform. Just
as with the Fourier-transform, I can talk about the FT of any function.</p>
<p>So what if I'm looking at <mathjax>$x(n) = \delta(n)$</mathjax>? <mathjax>$\hat{X}(z) = 1$</mathjax> -- we only
have one value in our sum. <mathjax>$R_x = \mathbb{C}$</mathjax>. In other words, <mathjax>$0 \le
\abs{z}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p><mathjax>$$
\delta(n-1) \ztrans z^{-1}\:\: (R_h = \set{z : 0 &lt; \abs{z}})
\\ \delta(n+1) \ztrans z\:\: (R_h = \set{z : 0 \le \abs{z} &lt; \infty})
$$</mathjax></p>
<p>Now, two-point moving average: <mathjax>$\frac{1}{2}\parens{\delta(n) + \delta(n-1)}
\ztrans \frac{1 + z^{-1}}{2} = \frac{z + 1}{2z}\ (R_h = \set{z : 0 &lt;
\abs{z}})$</mathjax>. Note that if this had been an anti-causal two-point moving
average, we'd include 0 and exclude infinity.</p>
<p>All of these signals so far are finite-duration signals (FIR filters).</p>
<p><strong>The radius of convergence of a function that has a finite region of
  support is the entire complex plane with the possible exception of zero,
  infinity, or both.</strong></p>
<p>Example of both: three-point moving average, centered at zero.</p>
<p>May have noticed already that region of convergence has a particular
convergence so far: all of these resemble a radius, and rational in z. Not
always the case, but these are most of the signals we'll work with. There's
a nice accounting between numerator and denominator that allows you to
determine where the region of convergence is.</p>
<h2>Ex: <mathjax>$h(n) = \alpha^n u(n)$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$\alpha \equiv \frac{3}{2}$</mathjax></h2>
<p><mathjax>$\hat{H}(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \parens{\frac{3}{2z}}^n = \frac{1}{1 -
\alpha z^{-1}} = \frac{z}{z - \alpha}$</mathjax>. RoC: <mathjax>$\set{z : \abs{z} &gt;
\frac{3}{2}}$</mathjax></p>
<p>When we talk about the z-transform, you can't just give an expression; you
also must provide a region of convergence. One without the other is an
incomplete picture.</p>
<h2>Plotting region of convergence:</h2>
<p>In this case, just draw a dotted circle (radius not included), and shade
its exterior.</p>
<p>This is not a proof, but notice that we've got a causal signal, and a
region of convergence that is outside of some circle (and extends to
infinity). Roots of the denominator are called <strong>poles</strong> of the
system. Roots of the numerator are called <strong>zeroes</strong>. Therefore this system
has one zero and one pole.</p>
<p>It turns out that for right-sided functions, the RoC is always to the
outside of the radius defined by the outermost pole.</p>
<p>One thing I want you to pay attention to is the following: the angle of the
pole makes no difference in the region of convergence (ever!). When you
look at <mathjax>$\hat{H}(z) = \sum_n h(n)z^{-n}$</mathjax> and replace <mathjax>$z = Re^{i\omega}$</mathjax>,
you notice that this is <mathjax>$\sum h(n)R^{-n}e^{-i\omega n}$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$e^{-i\omega n}$</mathjax>
plays no role in whether or not the kernel is absolutely summable.</p>
<p>So the region in the complex plane where this sum is convergent is
independent of <mathjax>$\omega$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>I could have made this <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> a complex number on the same radius, and
the region of convergence would have been exactly the same. It is the
magnitude of <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> that is important.</p>
<h2>Ex: <mathjax>$g(n) = -\alpha^n u(-(n+1))$</mathjax></h2>
<p>Notice that this is a left-sided signal.</p>
<p><mathjax>$\hat{G}(z) = -\sum_{-\infty}^{-1} \parens{\frac{\alpha}{z}}^n =
-\sum_1^\infty \parens{\frac{\alpha}{z}}^{-n^\prime} = \frac{z}{z -
\alpha}$</mathjax> (<mathjax>$\set{z : \abs{\alpha} &gt; \abs{z}}$</mathjax>)</p>
<p>This is exactly the same expression in z, but the region of convergence is
different. This is why we are compelled to always consider the region of
convergence.</p>
<p>So two very different expressions in time yield the same expression in
their z-transforms, but the difference is in their radii of convergence.</p>
<p>Just as with right-sided functions, the RoC for left-sided functions is
always inside the radius defined by the innermost pole.</p>
<h1>Monologuing</h1>
<p>With frequency response and Fourier transforms, we all knew what we were
trying to do. We were trying to decompose a signal into its constituent
frequencies. There is no such notion for the Z-transform. The whole idea of
stabilizing an unstable system when placing a system in a feedback
configuration requires the Z-transform.</p>
<p>Consider <mathjax>$\alpha^n u(n)$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>In this case, we have not specified whether <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> is inside or outside
the unit circle. The expression is exactly the same.</p>
<p>Let's take the first case, where <mathjax>$\abs{\alpha} &lt; 1$</mathjax>. The region of
convergence is outside the circle of radius <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax>. We could consider the
DTFT then. This is a case where the region of convergence strictly includes
the unit circle. If that is true, then there is a very simple relationship
between the z-transform and the Fourier transform: we can evaluate the
z-transform on the unit circle, i.e. <mathjax>$z = e^{i\omega}$</mathjax>. It is because of
this that some people consider the z-transform to be a generalization of
the Fourier transform. However, there are functions for which we have a
Fourier transform but no z-transform.</p>
<p>You also know that when the RoC contains the unit circle, the time-domain
function must be absolutely summable: the z-transform looks like the
Fourier transform of <mathjax>$R^{-n}h(n)$</mathjax>. The point of <mathjax>$R^{-n}$</mathjax> is to tame the
function.</p>
<p>If <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> is outside the unit circle, no such relationship exists between
the z-transform and Fourier transform, simply because there is no Fourier
transform.</p>
<p>Now let's consider the anti-causal case: <mathjax>$-\alpha^n u(-(n+1))$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>If <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> happens to be within the unit circle, the function has no
Fourier transform. But if <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> is outside the unit circle, then
the function has a Fourier transform.</p>
<p>So that's the relationship between the z-transform and the Fourier
transform: if the region of convergence contains the unit circle, then you
can equate them.</p>
<p>If <mathjax>$h(n) \ztrans \hat{H}(z)$</mathjax>, then <mathjax>$h(n-1) \ztrans \frac{\hat{H}(z)}
{z}$</mathjax>. Similarly, <mathjax>$h(n+1) \ztrans z\hat{H}(z)$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>There is a difference between bounded and unbounded regions of
convergence. </p>
<p>We have a few minutes, so let me talk about the distinctions between causal
signals and right-sided signals (and also anticausal / left-sided).</p>
<p>So let's say we take a right-sided but not causal signal. Now the RoC is
outside of radius <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax>, but now you have to exclude $\infty.</p>
<p>Similarly, for left-sided signals, you'd then exclude 0.</p>
<h1>EE 120: Signals and Systems</h1>
<h1>More on the <mathjax>$\mathcal{Z}$</mathjax>-transform</h1>
<p><mathjax>$$
h(n) \ztrans \hat{H}(z) = \infsum{n} h(n) z^{-n}
\\ R_h = \text{region of convergence}
\\ \defequals \set{z \in \cplx \middle| \sum_n \abs{h(n) z^{-n}} &lt; \infty}
$$</mathjax></p>
<p>For signals of finite duration, the region of convergence is the entire
complex plane, minus possibly <mathjax>$r=0$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$r=\infty$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Example which was causal, <mathjax>$x(n) = \alpha^n u(n)$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\hat{X}(z) = \frac{1}{1
- \alpha z^{-1}}$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$\abs{\alpha} &lt; \abs{z}$</mathjax> (i.e. outside the circle).</p>
<p>We also had an anticausal example, <mathjax>$q(n) = -\alpha^n u(-n-1)$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\hat{Q}(z)
= \frac{1}{1 - \alpha z^{-1}}$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$\abs{z} &lt; \abs{\alpha}$</mathjax> (i.e. inside the
circle).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we discussed that a Fourier transform existed if and only if
the unit circle was contained in the region of convergence.</p>
<p>Notice that the RoC of a causal system was outside, all the way to
infinity, while the RoC of an anticausal was inside, all the way to zero.</p>
<p>We further learned that causal signals are a subset of right-sided signals,
and anti-causal signals are a subset of left-handed signals.</p>
<p>So what happens if we shift our signal, i.e. <mathjax>$r(n) = x(n+1)$</mathjax>?</p>
<p><mathjax>$\hat{R}(z) = z\hat{X}(\omega)$</mathjax>. This is a simple example of what we call
the time-shift property. You can guess what happens when we shift by an
arbitrary integer. <mathjax>$x(n-N) \ztrans z^N X(z)$</mathjax>. Note that this is no longer
causal, but it is still right-sided.</p>
<p>Notice that now the signal blows up at infinity, so our radius of
convergence is now <mathjax>$R_r: \abs{\alpha} &lt; \abs{z} &lt; \infty$</mathjax>. The set of
right-sided signals is a strict superset of the set of causal signals.</p>
<p>This is the difference between the z-transform of right-sided signals and
that of causal signals.</p>
<p>Similarly, with a left-sided signal, we would exclude the origin from the
RoC.</p>
<p>There's also a simple way of showing why causal signals are outside of some
radius of convergence.</p>
<p>Let x be causal. Its z-transform starts from the earliest possible point,
i.e. <mathjax>$n = 0$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\hat{X}(z) = x(0) + \frac{x(1)}{z} + ... $</mathjax>.</p>
<p>If <mathjax>$\abs{z} = R_1 \in R_x$</mathjax>, I want you to argue why <mathjax>$\abs{z} = R_2$</mathjax>, where
<mathjax>$R_1 &lt; R_2$</mathjax> is also in the RoC. Reasoning: with larger radii, we have
smaller values in our absolute sum.</p>
<p>Right-sided signals: almost identical, except we have a finite number of
elements on the left, and so infinity must be excluded.</p>
<p>Once you find the radius at which the sum converges, everything else
outside also converges.</p>
<p>Similar argument for anti-causal and left-sided signals.</p>
<p>So now let's combine these.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p><mathjax>$g(n) = \parens{\frac{1}{2}}^n u(n) - \parens{\frac{3}{2}}^n u(-n-1)$</mathjax></p>
<p>As done before, we have <mathjax>$\frac{1}{1 - \alpha z^{-1}}$</mathjax> for both values of
"<mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax>". Thus our region of convergence is <mathjax>$\frac{1}{2} &lt; \abs{r} &lt;
\frac{3}{2}$</mathjax> (superposition tells us the corresponding z-transform is
<mathjax>$\frac{2z}{2z - 1} + \frac{2z}{2z - 3} = \frac{2z(z-1)}{(z-\frac{1}{2})
(z-\frac{3}{2})}$</mathjax>).</p>
<p>As you can see, two-sided signals have annular regions for their RoCs.</p>
<p>Reason for zeroes: if I were to ask you to find the inverse of the system,
what would you do? Let's say this represents distortion, and you want to
undo the distortion.</p>
<p>Also comes into play when you want to plot the frequency response.</p>
<p>Let's do another</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p><mathjax>$h(n) = \expfrac{3}{2}{n}u(n) - \expfrac{1}{2}{n} u(n-1)$</mathjax>. Now we've got
<strong>nothing</strong> -- there is no overlap between the two regions, so there is
neither a Z-transform nor a region of convergence. (we would have the same
expression, but this doesn't hold anywhere.)</p>
<h2>Intermission</h2>
<h1>Time Shift Property</h1>
<p><mathjax>$x(n-N) \to z^{-N}\hat{X}(z)$</mathjax>. What does this do to the region of
convergence? It can potentially eliminate infinity (if N positive) or zero
(if N negative), but not both.</p>
<h1>Convolution Property</h1>
<p>If you have <mathjax>$h \equiv f \star g \ztrans \hat{H}(z) =
\hat{F}(z)\hat{G}(z)$</mathjax>. Simple way to show this is by cascading filters and
feeding in (instead of a complex exponential) <mathjax>$z^n$</mathjax> -- this is identical to
the eigenfunction property of LTI systems. And what's the RoC? <mathjax>$R_h \supset
(R_f \cap R_g)$</mathjax> (could be bigger if pole-zero cancellation occurs)</p>
<p>Think of these poles as dam (damn?) walls.</p>
<p>If we put this system in cascade with another one such that <mathjax>$q(n) =
\delta(n) - \frac{1}{2}\delta(n-1)$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$\hat{Q}(z) = \frac{z-\frac{1}{2}}
{z}$</mathjax>. Since this is a FIR filter, <mathjax>$R_q = \cplx - \set{0}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p><mathjax>$\hat{A}(z) = \hat{R}(z)\hat{Q}(z) = \frac{2(z-1)}{z - \frac{3}{2}}$</mathjax> . We
get double pole-cancellation, in fact, so <mathjax>$R_q = \set{z \middle| \abs{z} &lt;
\frac{3}{2}}$</mathjax>.</p>
<h1>Time-reversal</h1>
<p><mathjax>$x(n) \ztrans \hat{X}(z)$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$x(-n) \ztrans ?$</mathjax> Do a variable substitution,
and then you see that everywhere you had <mathjax>$z$</mathjax>, it's now a <mathjax>$z^{-1}$</mathjax>. Thus
<mathjax>$x(-n) \ztrans \hat{X}(\frac{1}{z})$</mathjax>. When you correlate this with the
Fourier-transform story, we got a frequency reversal in the frequency
domain. Locations of poles and zeroes map to their inverses,
i.e. <mathjax>$\hat{X}(z_0) \to \hat{X}^\prime(\frac{1}{z_0})$</mathjax>.</p>
<h1>Multiplication by a complex exponential</h1>
<p>Presume
<mathjax>$$
g(n) \ztrans \hat{G}(z)
\\ h(n) = z_0^n g(n) \ztrans \hat{H}(z) = ?
$$</mathjax></p>
<p><mathjax>$\hat{G}(\frac{z}{z_0})$</mathjax>, after the dust clears. If <mathjax>$p_0$</mathjax> is a pole of
<mathjax>$\hat{G}$</mathjax>, it moves to <mathjax>$z_0p_0$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Z-transform of the unit step? <mathjax>$\frac{1}{1 - z^{-1}}$</mathjax>, where <mathjax>$1 &lt;
\abs{z}$</mathjax>. This is a perfect example of why the z-transform is not a strict
superset of the Fourier transform -- that only happens when the unit circle
is strictly part of the RoC. Otherwise you can't evaluate the expression
there.</p>
<p>Z-transform of the tone burst (suddenly-applied cosine wave)? We've done
this (albeit in parts).</p>
<p>Note that radius of convergence isn't changing.</p>
<p>Will leave it to you to figure out what the transform of <mathjax>$r^n \cos(\omega_0
n) u(n)$</mathjax> is.</p>
<h1>EE 120: Signals and Systems</h1>
<h1>Upsampling property</h1>
<p><mathjax>$$
x(n) \mapsto \uparrow N \mapsto y(n) = \begin{cases}
x(n/N) &amp; \text{if } n \equiv 0 (\mod N)
\\ 0 &amp; \rm{e/w}
\end{cases}
$$</mathjax></p>
<p>i.e. we have the same values, but now interspersed with more zeroes. Take
the axis and dilate by three. So see if you can come up with an expression
for the Z-transform of the upsampled signal. We should just have
<mathjax>$\hat{X}(z^N)$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>This should not surprise you. When you upsampled in the time domain, what
happened in frequency? We contracted in the frequency domain. You get that
even from here. If I remind you of an example we did eons ago, <mathjax>$y(n) =
\alpha y(n-1) + x(n)$</mathjax> had a frequency response of <mathjax>$G(\omega) = \frac{1}{1 -
\alpha e^{-i\omega}}$</mathjax>. If I change this to the parameters of <mathjax>$y(n) = \alpha
y(n-N) + x(n)$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$H(\omega) = \frac{1}{1 - \alpha e^{i\omega N}$</mathjax>. But if you
compare <mathjax>$g(n) = \alpha^n u(n)$</mathjax> with <mathjax>$h(n) = \alpha^{nN} u(n)$</mathjax>, we've
already seen this.</p>
<p>So when you upsample, you have the <mathjax>$z$</mathjax> raised to the <mathjax>$n^{th}$</mathjax> power.</p>
<p>What's the RoC? Should bring up two more questions: what happens to the
poles and zeroes? We take the <mathjax>$n^{th}$</mathjax> root of everything (i.e. the inverse
function), so everything moves closer to 1. (rationale: <mathjax>$z_p^N = p \implies
z_p = ?$</mathjax>. We get <mathjax>$N$</mathjax> times as many poles, in fact, since we have <mathjax>$N$</mathjax> roots
of <mathjax>$p$</mathjax>. ibid for zeros.</p>
<p>Going back to the question for the region of convergence for y: if the RoC
for x is <mathjax>$R_1 &lt; \abs{z} &lt; R_2$</mathjax>, the RoC for y is <mathjax>$R_1 &lt; \abs{z}^N &lt; R_2$</mathjax>,
so <mathjax>$R_y = R_x^{1/N}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>So let's do the example given earlier: <mathjax>$y(n) = \alpha y(n-N) + x(n)$</mathjax>.
<mathjax>$\hat{H}_1(z) = \frac{1}{1 - \alpha z^{-1}}$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\hat{H}_4 = \frac{1}{1 -
\alpha z^{-4}}$</mathjax>. Draw pole-zero diagrams, region of convergence?</p>
<p>(note that we've got degeneracy -- multiplicity. Must denote with a number
in parentheses if you've got multiplicity greater than 2; if multiplicity
is 2, you can use a double-circle or double-x).</p>
<h1>Differentiation</h1>
<p>Another property that's actually very important is differentiation in Z. So
suppose you've transformed <mathjax>$x \ztrans \hat{X}(z)$</mathjax>. What is <mathjax>$\deriv{\hat{X}}
{z}$</mathjax>? <mathjax>$-z\deriv{\hat{X}}{z} \ztrans n(x(n)$</mathjax>.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p><mathjax>$g(n) = n\alpha^n u(n) \ztrans \hat{G}(z) = ?$</mathjax></p>
<p>If you want to make this look like the original form, just multiply top and
bottom by <mathjax>$z^{-2}$</mathjax>. Very important point: extension to higher derivatives.</p>
<p>So what happens as we increase this? What does this mean?</p>
<p>We can decompose any rational z transform into a linear composition of
lower-order terms. Fundamental theorem of
algebra. Proposition: suppose we've got a transfer function. We've got a
numerator over a denominator. We can factor the numerator and
denominator. You also learned that whenever you do this, you can break
apart the ratio in terms of a sum.</p>
<p>Note that this starts breaking when you have degeneracy (i.e. systems with
duplicate poles). So from this qualitative argument, it should not surprise
you if I tell you that the only way you can get a rational Z-transform is
if the system is the sum of one-sided exponentials multiplied by
some polynomial.</p>
<p>We'd also have to include the left-sided versions of these.</p>
<p>We can make a general statement: a Z-transform expression <mathjax>$\hat{X}(z)$</mathjax> is
rational iff x(n) is a linear combination of terms <mathjax>$n^k \alpha^n u(n)$</mathjax>,
<mathjax>$n^k\beta^n u(-n)$</mathjax>. Shifted versions will certainly also work.</p>
<p>Using partial fractions is one of the methods of doing an inverse
transform. We're not going to learn a formal inverse Z-transform; we're
just going to use various heuristics (not unlike solving differential
equations).</p>
<p>In general, inverse z-transform requires a contour integral (complex
analysis) and thus is not a required in this class.</p>
<p>Now, if you believe this, we've got several things: <mathjax>$n^k\alpha^n u(n)$</mathjax>,
LCCDEs, and rational Z-transforms. They form a family.</p>
<h1>LCCDEs and Rational Z Transforms</h1>
<p>Suppose I've got an input, an impulse response, and an output. You know
this is a convolution of x and h, so <mathjax>$\hat{Y} = \hat{X}\hat{Z}$</mathjax>, which
means the transfer function of an LTI system is the ratio of the transform
of the output to the transform of the input (for LTI systems).</p>
<p>Frequency response of the filter gives you the Fourier transform of the
output.</p>
<p>We can write our difference equation as <mathjax>$\sum_{k=0}^N a_k y(n-k) = \sum_m^M
b_m x(n-m)$</mathjax>. We've seen this.</p>
<p>One way to get the transfer function is to take the z-transforms of both
sides. If they're equal in the time domain, their z-transforms must also be
equal in the frequency domain. Time-shift property. Just considering the
ratio <mathjax>$\hat{H} \equiv \frac{\hat{Y}}{\hat{X}}$</mathjax>, we have our transfer
function.</p>
<p>Familiarize yourself with going from the LCCDE to the transfer function by
inspection.</p>
<p>Now, for the end of the lecture: irrational Z-transform.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>This is a standard example in practically any signal-processing book you'll
find. <mathjax>$\hat{X} = \log(1 + \alpha z^{-1}$</mathjax>. Determine <mathjax>$x(n)$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>(differentiation property)</p>
<p>(<mathjax>$\frac{(-1)^{n-1} \alpha^n}{n}u(n-1)$</mathjax>)</p>
<p>You can also use (to check) Taylor expansion centered at 1: <mathjax>$\log(1 +
\lambda) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1} \lambda^n}{n}$</mathjax>.</p>
