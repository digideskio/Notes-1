<h2>Monday, January 23</h2>
<p>Use of Mathematica/Matlab/WolframAlpha encouraged for homework.</p>
<p>Recap. Talk about <em>how</em> uncertain, measured by product of two related
properties, e.g. momentum + position Schrödinger's equation.</p>
<p>Classical mechanics teaches us (incorrectly!) that physics is
deterministic. This is actually just the most likely path that you can
follow from point a to point b.</p>
<p>The issue is that we have Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, so it is
impossible to precisely know momentum and position simultaneously.</p>
<p>three primary interpretations of QM
 * Einstein - deterministic (hidden variables). Wrong.
   + "God does not play dice."
   + Not enough information to fully ascertain position of particle;
     must be an issue with the theory.
 * Copenhagen (Bohr) - nondeterministic. Widely accepted.
   + "orthodox position", 
   + Actually does exist in all possible results simultaneously until
     measurement is made and wavefunction is collapsed.
 * "agnostic position": who cares?</p>

<p>This potential is symmetric in momentum and position. A wave packet in
coordinate space, if you Fourier-transform it, is the same wave packet is
momentum space. Has this property that if you want to do many-body physics
(not in this class) and use as a basis the harmonic oscillator, then you
get nice stuff that happens. One of the great things about the harmonic
oscillator is that, say you have 3 particles. Three coordinates describing
them. Most of the time, you're not interested in said coordinates, but
rather what the wave function looks like. Take out center-of-mass
motion. You have the same problem in general many-body theory. Excitations
in nucleus, whatever. Would love to have a big set of basis states where
you could write things down simply and just work with the interesting
part. The harmonic oscillator allows you to do that. For all these reasons
this problem is actually important, but you don't see them in the
textbook. tl;dr: this makes life easier when you get to harder problems.</p>
<p>You recognize such a potential because of springs. W = kx²/2. Because the
potential is quadratic, the restoring force is linear. You can calculate
the frequency omega ≡ √(k/m)</p>
<p>Let's start by writing down the time-independent Schrödinger
equation. There's a potential term, and that we'll write as ½momega². What prof
is going to do is straight out of the book, so don't take notes. Cool.</p>

<h2>Friday, February 10</h2>
<p>So, last time we were doing a harmonic oscillator. Calculation takes two
full lectures. Energy has to be quantized. Good first start. Lots of
motivation for the harmonic oscillator. Useful in general for lots of
different interactions. The first step is to define the time-independent
solutions. First thing to do is to introduce a dimensionless coordinate.</p>
<p>Talk about solution to simple harmonic oscillator. Why it must be a finite
polynomial (actually, no good reason -- it's just easier). how to get said
finite polynomial. numerator has to vanish. result must be either odd or
even. it's in the math. working out hermite polynomials by hand. haven't
even gotten around to the closed-form version.</p>
<p>(n+1)(n+2)T(n+2) = (2n+1 - 2E/ℏomega)T(n)</p>
<p>δ(nm)√π 2ⁿn!. Orthogonal.</p>
<p>Recurrence relation. H{n+1} = 2yH{n} - 2n(H{n-1}.</p>
<p>dⁿH{n}/dn = 2nH{n-1}.</p>
<p>Now you just have to go ahead and plug in this formula into our wave
function. It's just a whole lot of algebra, so Haxton will just write down
the result instead of possibly getting it wrong. Will probably be in the
text.</p>
<p>You have to choose either a₀ or a₁ to be 0. Choosing both yields a useless
result.</p>
<p>blarg, orthog basis saves time.</p>
<p><strong>Protip: You can violate energy conservation as long as you don't do it
too much.</strong>
|x| &gt; √(ℏ/momega (2n+1)) ⇒ ∫Ψ*x²Ψdx.</p>
<p>whenever you have an x that is more than twice its root-mean-square, you
are violating mathematics. Which is great. This happens 11% of the
time. This is excellent.</p>

<p>Recap: free particle schrödinger equation has a set of solutions. \Psi(x) =
1/√(2π)e^{ikx}. |Ψ(x)|² = 1/2π. Not normalizable. Analogous to sin, cos
functions in a box. -∞ &lt; k &lt; ∞. <em>both signs</em>. E{k} = ℏ²k²/2m</p>
<p>Finite a box. from -πa to πa.</p>
<p>e^{ikx} as our wave functions.</p>
<p>Boundary conditions: e^{-ikπa} = e^{ikπa}. PERIOD ≡ 1/a; freq ≡ a by
construction.</p>
<p>We now have a discrete set of wave functions over a finite width. We know
how to normalize this. Do what we would normally do. Our interval is (as
stated earlier) [-π/a,π/a]. blah, demonstration of orthonormality. Take
limit as a → ∞.</p>
<p>talk about boxes. lots of handwaving. sucky explanation of δ(r).</p>
<p>Now that we have our δ (finally!) we can just write down the answer. Or
not.</p>
<p>When all the dust clears, what do you get? What we've discovered from these
arguments is that we wanted to get these a{k}. So we had the right idea,
(not really) and we worked out the math by hand and had to check for
orthonormality as opposed to completeness.</p>
<p>We naturally get a(k′). "If you squint at this, it looks just like our
Krönecker delta."</p>
<p>The final step is that we write the solution. Evolves just as you expected
it to be. Plug it back into the Schrödinger equation.</p>
<p>(blarg, this is the Fourier transform. Finally. The <em>obvious</em> way to do the
problem.)</p>

<p>We'll set some zero energy, and a potential that has a depth of -V₀. This
is the base of our well. My wells are always symmetric around the origin,
and they always have width a. So we've got two regions: E &gt; 0 and E &lt; 0.</p>
<p>Negative energy: "is bound". It's just a shift of our ground. No physics
involved whatsoever. So we want to solve this problem. We'll do both bound
state and continuum solutions for this thing.</p>
<p>Curvature of the wave function corresponds to energy. If I look at the
energy (relative to 0) of the first and second eigenstates, the energy gaps
are going to be smaller than higher up.</p>
<p>Not an infinite number of energies, since it's not an infinite well. Gets

<p>Departure from this point; beginning of chapter 3.</p>
<p>Last time was a brief introduction. What we did Friday: Up to now:
differential equation to stationary states. But limiting!</p>
<p>Friday: Found them numerically: basis, then truncated: Physics. You have to
match truncation with Physics you want to capture in the problem.</p>
<p>Numerically diagonalized approximate stationary states.</p>
<p>Why? Fun applications; introduced notions of matrix form of <mathjax>$T + V$</mathjax>,
vectors as solutions to time-independent Schr\"odinger equation.</p>
<p>vectors: <mathjax>$\alpha_i\ket{x_i}$</mathjax>; inner products: <mathjax>$\braket{\alpha}{\beta}
\equiv \alpha^\dagger \beta$</mathjax>: linear transformations/operators: <mathjax>$\op{
\alpha}$</mathjax> (must be Hermitian, even). Representable by a matrix.</p>
<p>Our vector spaces are usually infinite. This should not confuse you.</p>
<p>Quantum vector spaces (Hilbert spaces -- this is technically a lie --
Hilbert spaces in this sense do not contain the zero matrix, nor are they
closed under anything -- it's really more of a k-sphere): examples:
infinite square well: <mathjax>$\sqrt{\frac{2}{a}} e^{i\pi nx/a}$</mathjax></p>

<p>Recap: spectral theorem; completeness of eigenfunctions.</p>
<p>Dirac orthonormality (consider Fourier transform)</p>
<p>Now it gets a little more interesting. Suppose we have some wave packet
(the book calls this generalized statistical interpretation). Not this
example, but the next which will be important. Will tell when you can label
with more than one quantum number.</p>
<p>Reason why this is being done is because you can start thinking about
operators abstractly. Fact that you know the general theorems that go with
any operator, etc.</p>
<p>Let's go through and see what he means by this idea of a generalized
statistical interpretation. Consider operator H (hamiltonian). We'll have
some wave packet <mathjax>$\Phi\equiv \alpha_i\ket{\phi_i}$</mathjax>. The expansion of this
is simply <mathjax>$\braKet{\Phi}{H}{\Phi}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>There will be an eigenspectrum corresponding to all the possible outcomes
of a measurement. You'll wind up getting this completeness relationship,
where the probabilities correspond to the coefficients.</p>
<p>probability of a particle being at a specific point means nothing in
continuous case -- rather, we have to speak of it being found in some
interval.</p>
<p>Let's write out this idea of simultaneous measurements and commuting
operators.</p>
<p>So now let's go ahead and compute that the commutator is zero.</p>
<p>Another way to measure how different these eigenvectors are is to see
whether these matrices commute or not. If they commute, they have a common
set of eigenvectors. Commuting means <mathjax>$XZ - ZX = 0$</mathjax>. So we want to look at <mathjax>$XZ
- ZX$</mathjax> (a commutator, denoted by <mathjax>$[X,Z]$</mathjax>).</p>
<p>So what does this look like between <mathjax>$\hat{x}$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$\hat{p}$</mathjax>? We have product
rule coming into play... yielding <mathjax>$[x,p] \equiv i\hbar$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>We'll use this to derive <mathjax>$\Delta x\Delta p = \hbar/2$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Recall: given an observable A and a state <mathjax>$\ket{Ψ}$</mathjax>, the expected value is
<mathjax>$\braKet{\Psi}{A}{\Psi}$</mathjax>. We also saw that the variance was <mathjax>$E(x^2) -
E(x)^2$</mathjax>, so in this case <mathjax>$\sigma^2 = \braKet{\Psi}{A^2}{\Psi} -
\braKet{\Psi}{A}{\Psi}^2$</mathjax>.</p>

<p>Uncertainty relation: what is its meaning? How do you measure a particle?
Observations disturb state.</p>
<p>Uncertainty principle is why we exist. Hydrogen atom: proton surrounded by
some electron orbit. THe size of the proton is roughly <mathjax>$10^{-15} m$</mathjax>, or one
fm (fermi, as we come to know it). THe electron sits a distance <mathjax>$a_0$</mathjax> (Bohr
radius) away from the proton, roughly <mathjax>$5 \cdot 10^{-11}$</mathjax>. Pauli exclusion
principle leads to repulsive force. 1931: Ehrenfest postulated. Later,

causes normal force: matter would be much squishier.</p>
<p>H = T + V. We know <mathjax>$T = \frac{p^2}{2m}$</mathjax>, and V is given by <mathjax>$-\frac{e^2}{r
4\pi\epsilon_0}$</mathjax>. We thus have <mathjax>$\int d^3x \Psi^*\parens{-\frac{\hbar^2}
{2m}\nabla^2 \Psi}$</mathjax>. This is roughly <mathjax>$R$</mathjax>. Then we know the kinetic energy,
which is the sum of all the momenta, <mathjax>$\frac{1}{2m}\avg{p_x^2 + p_y^2 +
p_z^2} = \frac{1}{2m}3\frac{\hbar^2}{4R^2} \approx \frac{3}{8}
\frac{\hbar^2}{mR^2}$</mathjax>. So <mathjax>$\avg{H} \approx \frac{3}{8}\frac{\hbar^2}{mR^2}
- \frac{e^2}{R4\pi\epsilon_0}$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\pderiv{}{R}\avg{H} = 0$</mathjax>. Therefore <mathjax>$R =

<p>There's another uncertainty relation that's common to write down, i.e. the
time-energy uncertainty principle. Time scale for observable quantity:
width of particle inversely proportional to lifetime.</p>

momentum acting on Gaussian, it's effectively <mathjax>$-\frac{\hbar}{i} \frac{1}{2

<p>Time dependence shows up explicitly in some operators; none that we've

<p>Two things to take away: <mathjax>$\pderiv{}{t}\avg{\hat{Q}_H} = \frac{i}{\hbar}
\avg{\comm{\hat{H}}{\hat{Q}_H}} + \avg{\pderiv{Q_H^\prime}{t}}$</mathjax>. We can use
this to derive the generalized uncertainty principle: <mathjax>$\sigma_H^2\sigma_Q^2
\ge \avg{\frac{1}{2i}\comm{H}{\hat{Q}}}^2\implies \sigma_H\sigma_Q \ge
\frac{\hbar}{2}\abs{\pderiv{\avg{\hat{Q}}}{t}}$</mathjax>. Using this for energy and

<h2>Monday, April 2</h2>
<p>for small r, the singular parts have to be equal. We know that <mathjax>$U_l$</mathjax> looks
like <mathjax>$Ar^{l+1} + Br^{-l}$</mathjax>. The second term has to be zero, since that
would diverge.</p>
<p>First example we can solve: analogue of infinite square well. Inifnite
potential beyond <mathjax>$r = a$</mathjax>. Conceptually: confinement of particle in 3-D. Now
confined in three dimensions.</p>
<p>Introduce wave number <mathjax>$k = \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar}$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\deriv{^2 u}{r^2} =
\bracks{\frac{l(l+1)}{r^2} - k^2}u$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$u(r) = A\sin kr + B\cos kr$</mathjax>. B must
be zero, since wave function is zero at origin. At <mathjax>$r = a$</mathjax>, wave function
must also vanish. So we must have <mathjax>$ka = n\pi$</mathjax>. So you have your
quantization, so your energies are <mathjax>$E = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2 a^2}{2ma^2} =
\frac{\hbar^2 n^2 \pi^2}{2ma^2}$</mathjax>. We've learned that the difference between
one-dimensional and three-dimensional case is angular momentum, but there
is no angular momentum in an s wave. So this looks very similar to infinite
square well: we just have the additional boundary condition that <mathjax>$u(0) =
0$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>So the total solution for this, <mathjax>$\Psi_{nlm}(\vec{r}) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}
Y_{00}(nx) \frac{\sin(n\pi r/a)}{r} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}\frac{\sin(n\pi
r/a)}{\sqrt{4\pi}{r}}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>spherical bessel function -- sinc?</p>
<p><mathjax>$\Psi_{n00}(\vec{r} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi a}}\frac{n\pi}{a} \sinc(\frac
{nr}{a}) = n\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1}{a^{3/2}} J_0(\kappa r); \kappa
\equiv \frac{n\pi}{a}$</mathjax></p>
<p><mathjax>$J_0$</mathjax> is our spherical Bessel function. Two places: scattering (coming in
with plane wave, outgoing wave is spherically symmetric wave function that
spreads out from the scatterer, so write as plane wave and stuff
(e.g. <mathjax>$e^{i\vec{k}\cdot \vec{r}} = \sum_{lm} Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi)Y^*_{lm}
(\theta_k, \phi_k)$</mathjax> -- turns into a Bessel function).</p>
<p>General problem we actually wanted to solve: <mathjax>$\bracks{\deriv{^2}{r^2} + k^2
- \frac{\ell(\ell + 1)}{r^2}}u_\ell(r) = 0$</mathjax>. This leads to
  <mathjax>$\bracks{r^2\deriv{^2}{r^2} + 2r\deriv{}{r} + k^2r^2 - \ell(\ell + 1)}
  R_{n\ell} = 0 \implies \bracks{k^2r^2\deriv{^2}{k^2r^2} + 2kr\deriv{}{kr}
  + k^2r^2 - \ell(\ell + 1)} R_{n\ell} \\ = 0 = \bracks{z^2\deriv{^2}{z^2} +
  2z\deriv{}{z} + z^2 - \ell(\ell + 1)} R_{n\ell}(z)$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are two classes of solutions: "good" and "bad"
solutions. General form is going to be <mathjax>$R_{n\ell}(kr) = AJ_\ell(kr) +
Bn_\ell (kr)$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$n_\ell$</mathjax> is a different spherical Bessel function that is
poorly-behaved, Another set of Bessel functions called the spherical Hankel
functions. This is one particular case where they map onto sinusoids; the
case where they map onto complex exponentials corresponds to the Hankel
functions.</p>
<p>The <mathjax>$J_\ell$</mathjax> are our good solutions; the <mathjax>$n_\ell$</mathjax> (<mathjax>$n_0 =
-\frac{\cos(x)}{x}$</mathjax>) are our bad functions.</p>
<p><mathjax>$J_1(x) = \frac{\sin x}{x^2} - \frac{\cos x}{x}$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$n_1(x) = -\frac{\cos
x}{x^2} - \frac{\sin x}{x}$</mathjax>. Recursion formula (not in the book): <mathjax>$f_{\ell
+ 1}(x) = \frac{2\ell + 1}{x}f_\ell(x) - f_{\ell-1}(x)$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>For small x, <mathjax>$J_\ell(x) \approx \frac{x^\ell}{(2\ell + 1)!!}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Note that in the general case, <mathjax>$AJ_\ell(ka) = 0$</mathjax>. Eigenvalue problem for
all <mathjax>$\ell$</mathjax>. So what you need to do is find the math tables. Find the
<mathjax>$B_{n\ell}$</mathjax>, which are the <mathjax>$n^{th}$</mathjax> zeros of the <mathjax>$\ell^{th}$</mathjax> spherical

<p>Radial wave function, Exponential that goes like <mathjax>$e^{-r/an}$</mathjax>. Scale should
jump out at you. You get this feeling as you go to higher and higher
states, stuff gets weaker, and whatever. Solns to Lapl's eq on sphere;
worked out formula using Frobenius method. Worked out eigenvalue problem;
had to have Laguerre polynomials -- auto-truncating, not unlike Hermite
polys. Write energies that correspond to truncation in one of two ways:
electron mass-energy. Could also write in terms of distance.</p>
<p>Book's normalization is weird -- usual: either constant term is 1 or
highest-order term has coefficient of 1.</p>
<p>Our <mathjax>$L_j^p$</mathjax> are gotten from the underlying Laguerre polynomials. The
Laguerre polynomials, going from the text's definition, is as follows:
<mathjax>$L_q(x) e^x\parens{\deriv{}{x}}^q\parens{e^{-x} x^q} = \sum_{k=0}^q (-1)^k
\expfrac{q!}{k!}{2}\frac{x^k}{(q-k)!}$</mathjax>. Thus our wave function <mathjax>$\psi_{n\ell

<p>We now have a really interesting trick: if we wanted to, we could have

<p>Maybe we can avoid some algebra. Invoke Wigner-Eckart theorem?</p>
<p>Two states with just one value of <mathjax>$m$</mathjax>. Must somehow be able to do these
operations efficiently.</p>
<p>Choice of bases is just a matter of convention. Underlying all of this must
be some result, some physical quantity that is independent of your
coordinate system. This is how you figure it out.</p>
<p>All of these matrix elements -- I'll write down the notation -- can be
written as a single element with no dependence on <mathjax>$m$</mathjax> (3-j symbol?).</p>
<p>Will see this stuff if you start to use it in practical
applications. Annoying, lots of algebra, but you get simple results that
allow you to do more stuff efficiently.</p>
<p>PREVIOUSLY in quantum mechanics: we wrote down <mathjax>$L^2 = (\vec{x} \times p)^2$</mathjax>
and stuff.</p>
<p>These are not pulled out of a hat: written out because we know what these
are in Cartesian coordinates, and we know how to transform from Cartesian
to spherical. Not doing derivation because that has nothing to do with
quantum mechanics. One of the problems for next homework: raising and
lowering operators in <mathjax>$L_\pm \equiv \pm \hbar e^{\pm i\phi}\parens{
\pderiv{}{\theta} \pm i\cos\theta\pderiv{}{itheta}}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Zeeman: decided to break spherical symmetry by putting hydrogen atom in
a magnetic field. Nice discretisation.</p>
<p>First observed by Pauli: looks like you missed a quantum number. When you
plot magnetic field, you see twice the number of states.</p>
<p>Talk about Alfred Landay. Pauli also coming at that time (just a kid at
that time, evidently, but did stuff like a paper on special
relativity). Missing quantum number?! Electron spin. Thought about this
classically. Idea was basically very interesting: source of this extra
quantum number. (internal!). Electrons had to have half-integer spins (from
Zeeman effect): here you would have two quantum numbers. Got 2 initially
for g-factor -- surprising quantum-mechanically. Applied to other problem:
fine structure splitting. Explained another factor explained by magnetic
moments. Needed a different value of g-factor (1). Pauli had two objections:
couldn't be right, since they were different values, and only one valid
radius you could use: <mathjax>$r = \frac{e^2}{m c^2}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Figuring out how fast this surface was rotating, had to be 100x speed of
light. Special relativity says this is impossible. Told same thing to Niels
Bohr,</p>
<p>Nine months later, two guys in Holland (also very young) had exactly the
same idea: had notion that there must be a new quantum number, almost must
be spin; talked to their boss Ehrenfest. Said it was either nonsense or
very important. Then said to talk to most famous Dutch theorist at the time
Lorentz. Lorentz said everything was nonsense. Turns out this wasn't
stupid: within two years they figured out problems. First, not classical
spin. Also had interaction that looked like inner product between spin and
angular momentum. This is what gives the fine structure splitting.</p>
<p>Should have used Dirac's equation: need relativity.</p>
<p>Nobody ever heard about the guy who actually discovered spin. Moral: don't
listen to anyone over 30, and publish if you have something to discuss.</p>
<p>If you want a fantastic review article (just wonderful), Jean Cummins from
the atomic group. Coming out in a couple months. Called "electron
spin". Talking about how theories were broken. How to fix in new QM.</p>
<p>So what is this spin? The idea is that spin is an intrinsic quantity and
quantum-mechanical, so don't try to think of it as a spinning soccer
ball. Same algebra. What we're going to do is build this with something
that we do have classical relations for, i.e. orbital angular momentum. Go
through cyclical permutations, and this again can be summarized in this
relationship that <mathjax>$\comm{S_i}{S_j} \equiv i\hbar\epsilon_{ijk}S_k$</mathjax>. Once
again, you can choose eigenfunctions with quantum numbers <mathjax>$s,
m_s$</mathjax>. Electron has  <mathjax>$s = \frac{1}{2}$</mathjax> (fermions).</p>
<p>Diagonal quantum numbers: <mathjax>$s^2\ket{s m_s}= \frac{3}{4}\hbar^2 \ket{s m_s}$</mathjax>,
<mathjax>$s_z \ket{s m_s} \equiv \hbar m \ket{s m_s}$</mathjax>. You can do raising and
lowering operators just as before: mimic what we did with angular orbital
momentum. All particles are fundamental: point-like. Test with <mathjax>$e^\pm,
\mu^\pm, \tau^\pm$</mathjax> (electrons, muons, tauons). Quarks: u,d/c,s/t,b. All of
these constitute our fermions.</p>
<p>We also have <mathjax>$\gamma, w^\pm, z$</mathjax>: our bosons.</p>
<p>Composite particles act just like elementary particles. The theory
(i.e. SM) thinks that various fermions (i.e. electrons, muons, tauons) are
also composed of quarks.</p>
