-----------------

numerator is 1, denominator is length of vector e^{iomega} - lpha. Task: plot
ratio as omega varies.

1/(1+lpha), 1/(1-α).

frequency response curve should be monotonically increasing from -π to 0
and decreasing from 0 to π. { talk about inflection points, concavity,
etc. Second derivatives. }

# Low-pass filter for 0<lpha<1. If we understand the geometry for this
  particular case, we can answer design-oriented questions. One question
  is, what if I want to sharpen the peak of this low-pass filter?

  * Answer: have lpha approach 1. Can't get too close – real-world has
	noise. Also, in trouble if lpha jumps onto or outside of the unit
	circle. Algebraic argument available, as well.
	: move lpha toward the unit circle (but still keep it inside)

# Can I make a high-pass filter out of this?

  * Yes. Set -1 < lpha < 0.
	: take lpha to -1 < α < 0

  * By taking lpha to be negative, we have the equivalent of a phase
	shift by π.

# Sharper high-pass filter?

  * Bring lpha closer to -1.

# What if we want the filter to peak @ an arbitrary frequency, say omega₀ =
  π/4?

  * Place lpha along the pole θ = omega₀.

  1/(1-|lpha|)

	observation: this filter is a complex filter (i.e. one whose impulse
	response h(n) is complex valued). This has its uses but is not always
	desirable.

  h(n) = lphaⁿu(n) = Rⁿe^{iomega₀n}

  g(n) = h(n)e^{iomega₀n} → G(omega) = H(ω-ω₀)

Example:
--------
LCCDE: linear constant coefficient difference equation

y(n) = lphay(n-N) + x(n). N is a positive integer, not necessarily 1.
y(-N) = ... = y(n) = 0

(|lpha| < 1)

h{N}(n) = lphah{N}(n-N) + δ(n) = !(n % N) && α^{n/N}.
H{N}(omega) = ∑lpha^{k}e^{-iomegaNk} (k from 0 to ∞)
  ∑(lphae^{-iomegaN})^k = 1/(1-αe^{-iomegaN})

|H{N}(omega)| = |e^{iomegaN}/(e^{iωN} - lpha)|

Use omega′ ≡ omegaN, then use a change of variables (after plotting) to recover the
initial basis and label axes and whatnot.

Or use some arbitrary argument that it's a contracted version by going back
to H(omega). Roughly equivalent either way.

Graph of |H(2omega)|, for 0<lpha<1:
∎   ...        ...
   —   –      –   –
  -     -    .     .
_-       -__-       -_
	 0          π
(No more graphs.)

Comb filter. (pick off values that are multiples of π/N)

design-oriented analysis. layers like an onion. they fit together very
well.

Analog system
-------------
g(t) = e^{-lphat}u(t), Re{α} > 0

G(omega) = ∫g(t)e^{-iomegat}dt
	 = 1/(lpha + iomega). Probably.
	 = 1/(iomega - (-lpha))

√(omega² + lpha²)
