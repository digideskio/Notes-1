-----------------

numerator is 1, denominator is length of vector e^{iω} - α. Task: plot
ratio as ω varies.

1/(1+α), 1/(1-α).

frequency response curve should be monotonically increasing from -π to
0 and decreasing from 0 to π. { talk about inflection points,
concavity, etc. Second derivatives. }

# Low-pass filter for 0<α<1. If we understand the geometry for this
  particular case, we can answer design-oriented questions. One
  question is, what if I want to sharpen the peak of this low-pass
  filter?

  * Answer: have α approach 1. Can't get too close – real-world has
	noise. Also, in trouble if α jumps onto or outside of the unit
	circle. Algebraic argument available, as well.
	: move α toward the unit circle (but still keep it inside)

# Can I make a high-pass filter out of this?

  * Yes. Set -1 < α < 0.
	: take α to -1 < α < 0

  * By taking α to be negative, we have the equivalent of a phase
	shift by π.

# Sharper high-pass filter?

  * Bring α closer to -1.

# What if we want the filter to peak @ an arbitrary frequency, say ω₀ = π/4?

  * Place α along the pole θ = ω₀.

  1/(1-|α|)

	observation: this filter is a complex filter (i.e. one whose impulse
	response h(n) is complex valued). This has its uses but is not always
	desirable.

  h(n) = αⁿu(n) = Rⁿe^{iω₀n}

  g(n) = h(n)e^{iω₀n} → G(ω) = H(ω-ω₀)

Example:
--------
LCCDE: linear constant coefficient difference equation

y(n) = αy(n-N) + x(n). N is a positive integer, not necessarily 1.
y(-N) = ... = y(n) = 0

(|α| < 1)

h{N}(n) = αh{N}(n-N) + δ(n) = !(n % N) && α^{n/N}.
H{N}(ω) = ∑α^{k}e^{-iωNk} (k from 0 to ∞)
  ∑(αe^{-iωN})^k = 1/(1-αe^{-iωN})

|H{N}(ω)| = |e^{iωN}/(e^{iωN} - α)|

Use ω′ ≡ ωN, then use a change of variables (after plotting) to
recover the initial basis and label axes and whatnot.

Or use some arbitrary argument that it's a contracted version by going
back to H(ω). Roughly equivalent either way.

Graph of |H(2ω)|, for 0<α<1:
∎   ...        ...
   —   –      –   –
  -     -    .     .
_-       -__-       -_
	 0          π
(No more graphs.)

Comb filter. (pick off values that are multiples of π/N)

design-oriented analysis. layers like an onion. they fit together very
well.

Analog system
-------------
g(t) = e^{-αt}u(t), Re{α} > 0

G(ω) = ∫g(t)e^{-iωt}dt
	 = 1/(α + iω). Probably.
	 = 1/(iω - (-α))

√(ω² + α²)
