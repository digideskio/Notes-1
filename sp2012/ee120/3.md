LTI Systems and Frequency Response
==================================
freq. response: H(omega)
(continuous-time?)

will learn set of systems for which sum doesn't converge, so we'll need a
new transform: laplace (z) transform

two-point moving average:
h(n) = .....||... (δ(n) + δ(n-1))/2
H(omega) = (1 + e^{-iomega})/2 = e^{-iω/2}(e^{iω/2} + e^{-iω/2})/2
	 = e^{-iomega/2}cos(omega/2)

frequency response of discrete-time systems is periodic: adding a multiple
of 2π will not change the result.

2π-periodicity of discrete-time LTI frequency responses. This means,
naturally, that we don't have to plot our functions everywhere; rather, we
only need to worry about a single period.

(looks like |cos(omega/2)|)

eigenfunction property of discrete LTI systems -- e^{iomega} → H(omega)e^{iω}

H*(omega) = ∑h*(k)e^{iomegak}

conjugate symmetry: H*(omega) = H(-omega). (generalization of "even"
functions)

if h(n) ∈ R ∀ n,
y(n) = Re{H(omega)e^{iomegan}} = |H(ω)|cos(ωn+∠H(ω))

x→H→y
h(n) = (1-lphaⁿ)/(1-α)

Ways to determine H(omega):

Method 1:
---------

H(omega) = ∑h(n)e^{-iomegan} = ∑(lphae^{-iω})ⁿ. Use usual formula for geometric
series, since this converges.

Method 2:
---------

Use eigenfunction property of the complex exponential. Frequency response
is probably defined. Let x(n) = e^{iomegan} (a pure tone).

y(n) = H(omega)e^{iomegan}. y(n-1) = H(ω)e^{iωn}e^{-iω}.
H(omega) = 1/(1-lphae^{-iomega}).

How we can plot the magnitude response
--------------------------------------

eliminate all negative complex exponentials. lpha is in the unit
circle. e^{iomega} is a point on the unit circle, so we can represent it with a
vector.

Consider graphically.
