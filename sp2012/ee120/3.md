LTI Systems and Frequency Response
==================================
freq. response: H(ω)
(continuous-time?)

will learn set of systems for which sum doesn't converge, so we'll
need a new transform: laplace (z) transform

two-point moving average:
h(n) = .....||... (δ(n) + δ(n-1))/2
H(ω) = (1 + e^{-iω})/2 = e^{-iω/2}(e^{iω/2} + e^{-iω/2})/2
     = e^{-iω/2}cos(ω/2)

frequency response of discrete-time systems is periodic: adding a
multiple of 2π will not change the result.

2π-periodicity of discrete-time LTI frequency responses. This means,
naturally, that we don't have to plot our functions everywhere;
rather, we only need to worry about a single period.

(looks like |cos(ω/2)|)

eigenfunction property of discrete LTI systems -- e^{iω} → H(ω)e^{iω}

H*(ω) = ∑h*(k)e^{iωk}

conjugate symmetry: H*(ω) = H(-ω). (generalization of "even"
functions)

if h(n) ∈ R ∀ n,
y(n) = Re{H(ω)e^{iωn}} = |H(ω)|cos(ωn+∠H(ω))

x→H→y
h(n) = (1-αⁿ)/(1-α)

Ways to determine H(ω):

Method 1:
---------
H(ω) = ∑h(n)e^{-iωn} = ∑(αe^{-iω})ⁿ. Use usual formula for geometric
series, since this converges.

Method 2:
---------
Use eigenfunction property of the complex exponential. Frequency
response is probably defined. Let x(n) = e^{iωn} (a pure tone).

y(n) = H(ω)e^{iωn}. y(n-1) = H(ω)e^{iωn}e^{-iω}.
H(ω) = 1/(1-αe^{-iω}).

How we can plot the magnitude response
--------------------------------------
eliminate all negative complex exponentials. α is in the unit
circle. e^{iω} is a point on the unit circle, so we can represent it
with a vector.

Consider graphically.
