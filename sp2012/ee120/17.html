$$</mathjax></p>
<p>For signals of finite duration, the region of convergence is the entire
complex plane, minus possibly <mathjax>$r=0$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$r=\infty$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Example which was causal, <mathjax>$x(n) = \alpha^n u(n)$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\hat{X}(z) = \frac{1}{1
- \alpha z^{-1}}$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$\abs{\alpha} &lt; \abs{z}$</mathjax> (i.e. outside the circle).</p>
<p>We also had an anticausal example, <mathjax>$q(n) = -\alpha^n u(-n-1)$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\hat{Q}(z)
= \frac{1}{1 - \alpha z^{-1}}$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$\abs{z} &lt; \abs{\alpha}$</mathjax> (i.e. inside the
circle).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we discussed that a Fourier transform existed if and only if
the unit circle was contained in the region of convergence.</p>
<p>Notice that the RoC of a causal system was outside, all the way to
infinity, while the RoC of an anticausal was inside, all the way to zero.</p>
<p>We further learned that causal signals are a subset of right-sided signals,
and anti-causal signals are a subset of left-handed signals.</p>
<p>So what happens if we shift our signal, i.e. <mathjax>$r(n) = x(n+1)$</mathjax>?</p>
<p><mathjax>$\hat{R}(z) = z\hat{X}(\omega)$</mathjax>. This is a simple example of what we call
the time-shift property. You can guess what happens when we shift by an
arbitrary integer. <mathjax>$x(n-N) \ztrans z^N X(z)$</mathjax>. Note that this is no longer
causal, but it is still right-sided.</p>
<p>Notice that now the signal blows up at infinity, so our radius of
convergence is now <mathjax>$R_r: \abs{\alpha} &lt; \abs{z} &lt; \infty$</mathjax>. The set of
right-sided signals is a strict superset of the set of causal signals.</p>
<p>This is the difference between the z-transform of right-sided signals and
that of causal signals.</p>
<p>Similarly, with a left-sided signal, we would exclude the origin from the
RoC.</p>
<p>There's also a simple way of showing why causal signals are outside of some
radius of convergence.</p>
<p>Let x be causal. Its z-transform starts from the earliest possible point,
i.e. <mathjax>$n = 0$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$\hat{X}(z) = x(0) + \frac{x(1)}{z} + ... $</mathjax>.</p>
<p>If <mathjax>$\abs{z} = R_1 \in R_x$</mathjax>, I want you to argue why <mathjax>$\abs{z} = R_2$</mathjax>, where
<mathjax>$R_1 &lt; R_2$</mathjax> is also in the RoC. Reasoning: with larger radii, we have
smaller values in our absolute sum.</p>
<p>Right-sided signals: almost identical, except we have a finite number of
elements on the left, and so infinity must be excluded.</p>
<p>Once you find the radius at which the sum converges, everything else
outside also converges.</p>
<p>Similar argument for anti-causal and left-sided signals.</p>
<p>So now let's combine these.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p><mathjax>$g(n) = \parens{\frac{1}{2}}^n u(n) - \parens{\frac{3}{2}}^n u(-n-1)$</mathjax></p>
<p>As done before, we have <mathjax>$\frac{1}{1 - \alpha z^{-1}}$</mathjax> for both values of
"<mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax>". Thus our region of convergence is <mathjax>$\frac{1}{2} &lt; \abs{r} &lt;
\frac{3}{2}$</mathjax> (superposition tells us the corresponding z-transform is
<mathjax>$\frac{2z}{2z - 1} + \frac{2z}{2z - 3} = \frac{2z(z-1)}{(z-\frac{1}{2})
(z-\frac{3}{2})}$</mathjax>).</p>
<p>As you can see, two-sided signals have annular regions for their RoCs.</p>
<p>Reason for zeroes: if I were to ask you to find the inverse of the system,
what would you do? Let's say this represents distortion, and you want to
undo the distortion.</p>
<p>Also comes into play when you want to plot the frequency response.</p>
<p>Let's do another</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p><mathjax>$h(n) = \expfrac{3}{2}{n}u(n) - \expfrac{1}{2}{n} u(n-1)$</mathjax>. Now we've got
<strong>nothing</strong> -- there is no overlap between the two regions, so there is
neither a Z-transform nor a region of convergence. (we would have the same
expression, but this doesn't hold anywhere.)</p>
<h2>Intermission</h2>
<h1>Time Shift Property</h1>
<p><mathjax>$x(n-N) \to z^{-N}\hat{X}(z)$</mathjax>. What does this do to the region of
convergence? It can potentially eliminate infinity (if N positive) or zero
(if N negative), but not both.</p>
<h1>Convolution Property</h1>
<p>If you have <mathjax>$h \equiv f \star g \ztrans \hat{H}(z) =
\hat{F}(z)\hat{G}(z)$</mathjax>. Simple way to show this is by cascading filters and
feeding in (instead of a complex exponential) <mathjax>$z^n$</mathjax> -- this is identical to
the eigenfunction property of LTI systems. And what's the RoC? <mathjax>$R_h \supset
(R_f \cap R_g)$</mathjax> (could be bigger if pole-zero cancellation occurs)</p>
<p>Think of these poles as dam (damn?) walls.</p>
<p>If we put this system in cascade with another one such that <mathjax>$q(n) =
\delta(n) - \frac{1}{2}\delta(n-1)$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$\hat{Q}(z) = \frac{z-\frac{1}{2}}
{z}$</mathjax>. Since this is a FIR filter, <mathjax>$R_q = \cplx - \set{0}$</mathjax>.</p>
<p><mathjax>$\hat{A}(z) = \hat{R}(z)\hat{Q}(z) = \frac{2(z-1)}{z - \frac{3}{2}}$</mathjax> . We
get double pole-cancellation, in fact, so <mathjax>$R_q = \set{z \middle| \abs{z} &lt;
\frac{3}{2}}$</mathjax>.</p>
<h1>Time-reversal</h1>
<p><mathjax>$x(n) \ztrans \hat{X}(z)$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$x(-n) \ztrans ?$</mathjax> Do a variable substitution,
and then you see that everywhere you had <mathjax>$z$</mathjax>, it's now a <mathjax>$z^{-1}$</mathjax>. Thus
<mathjax>$x(-n) \ztrans \hat{X}(\frac{1}{z})$</mathjax>. When you correlate this with the
Fourier-transform story, we got a frequency reversal in the frequency
domain. Locations of poles and zeroes map to their inverses,
i.e. <mathjax>$\hat{X}(z_0) \to \hat{X}^\prime(\frac{1}{z_0})$</mathjax>.</p>
<h1>Multiplication by a complex exponential</h1>
<p>Presume
<mathjax>$$
g(n) \ztrans \hat{G}(z)
\\ h(n) = z_0^n g(n) \ztrans \hat{H}(z) = ?
$$</mathjax></p>
<p><mathjax>$\hat{G}(\frac{z}{z_0})$</mathjax>, after the dust clears. If <mathjax>$p_0$</mathjax> is a pole of
<mathjax>$\hat{G}$</mathjax>, it moves to <mathjax>$z_0p_0$</mathjax>.</p>
