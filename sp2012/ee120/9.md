Discrete-Time Fourier Transform: continued
------------------------------------------

Recall the ideal low-pass filter. In time-domain, it had some
discontinuities. In freq domain, it was NOT absolutely summable. However,
it is square-summable. We have names for signals that behave in these
particular ways.

ℓ₁ signals: absolutely summable. ∑|x(n)| < ∞ (abuse of
notation, but useful at that).

ℓ₂ signals: Square summable. ∑|x(n)|² < ∞. Finite energy.

For discrete-time, if a signal is ℓ₁, it is ℓ₂. Converse not true.

∑|h(n)| = ∑{n=0 to ∞} |lpha|ⁿ = 1/(1-|α|) < ∞. h ∈ ℓ₁ ⇒ finite |H(omega)| and
smooth.

If x ∉ ℓ₁ but x ∈ ℓ₂, you run into a bit of a problem: cannot use analysis
equation, since summation will not converge. But we can define the Fourier
transform in that case to be the limit as N → ∞ of ∑{-N to N}
x(n)e^{-iomegan}. DTFTs are continuous (not necessarily smooth / infinitely
differentiable).

Turns out we get convergence in energy of the two signals. It's just for
you to bear in mind, since you have an infinite sum. The most well-behaved
functions are ℓ₁. They have nice DTFTs. Next level up in terms of
misbehavior is ℓ₂. Fourier transforms cannot be obtained through analysis
equation, but can be reverse-engineered or otherwise. DTFTs have
discontinuities.

We have yet another level up in terms of misbehavior. We have signals of
"slow growth". (zero growth) Examples: x(n) = 1, x(n) = n, x(n) =
e^{iomega₀n}. Basically, these are signals that grow no faster than
polynomially in time. (and signals that neither grow nor decay). Notice
these signals ∩ (ℓ₁ ∪ ℓ₂) = ∅. Cannot use analysis equation, but can use
synthesis equation. And their DTFTs have Dirac deltas.

Example:
x(n) = e^{iomega₀n} X(omega)? lphaδ(ω-ω₀). Strictly speaking, we'd have to write the
spectrum as a sum: we have a delta every 2π, starting at omega₀. But that's not
particularly interesting, since that looks messy. I'm just interested in
the interval here. As long as we know that it's 2π-periodic.

To get our lpha, we can and will use our synthesis equation:
lpha/2π∫δ(omega-omega₀e^{iωn}dω. α/2π e^{iω₀n} = e^{iω₀n} ⇒ α ≡ 2π.

πδ(omega-omega₀) + πδ(ω+ω₀) (2π-periodic, again)

For signals that belong to none of the previous categories, we have to
learn a new transform – Z-transform! Z-transform! Coming in March, to
theaters near you.

Why do ℓ₁ signals have finite DTFTs?

DTFT Properties

# Time-shifting

	If I have a signal that's Fourier-transformed? What do I get in the
	frequency domain if I shift the original signal?

	We get a phase shift: if we shift x(n) by N, our new X(omega) is multiplied
	by e^{-iomegaN}.

## Example / curveball

	H(omega) = e^{-iomega/2}
	which yields h(n)= (-1)^{n+1}/π(n-½)

Remember: convolution and multiplication are duals over the time and
frequency domains.

Not too long from now, we are going to start studying the sampling
theorem. One way to consider this as a half-delayed sample of X is to think
of X as having samples. We map this to a sequence of samples in continuous
time, split apart by T seconds (sampling period). Interpolation scheme that
we'll learn about, etc. I can shift to the left or right by an arbitrary
amount. So in continuous time, I take this signal and I shift it to the
right by T/2 seconds. So I take whatever this was, take samples spaced T
apart, then convert it back into Krönecker deltas.

This filter is called, for the reason described, a half-sample delay. You
essentially have to interpolate between the frequencies in discrete time
and sample the halfway points.

What happens if I multiply in the time domain by a complex exponential
(modulation)? The frequency domain is convolved with said exponential.

Using the analysis equation,we haveX(omega) = ∑x(n)e^{i(omega-ω₀)n} = X(ω-ω₀).

# Multiplying the time domain by e^{iomega₀} results in a frequency shift.

Multiplying by a complex exponential yields a shift in the other domain.

There is one property that is distinct, and that is the modulation
property (multiplication property).

q(n) = x(n)y(n) ↔ Q(omega). Not an ordinary convolution.

Q(omega) = ∑x(n)y(n)e^{-iomegan}

In particular, for x(n), use synthesis equation to replace x(n) with X(ξ)
(where ξ is a dummy variable).

Q(omega) = 1/2π ∑{n}∫{2π} X(ξ)e^{iξn}y(n)dξ e^{-iomegan}.
	 = 1/2π ∫{2π}dξX(ξ)∑{n}e^{-i(omega-ξ)n}y(n)dξ.
	 = 1/2π ∫{2π}dξX(ξ)Y(omega-λ).

What's special about this? It's only over a value of 2π. This is a very
special kind of convolution. We call this a circular convolution of x and
y. So x(n)y(n)↔ 1/2π (X*Y)(omega). (circled star)

Think of two functions plotted in terms of λ. One function, let's say, is
a square pulse wave thingy.

easy way of carrying out circular convolution: take one of the two
functions, keep one replica (e.g. the one from -π to π), and then do a
regular convolution with the other function. advice: choose the flipped +
shifted signal for elimination of replicas.
