More on causality
-----------------
(proof by contradiction of previous example)

(input zero up to a certain point, but the output is nonzero before said
point. output preceding input. In itself, it does not tell non-causality,
but if you know the system is either linear or time-invariant, then you
know it can't be causal.)

L and C implies not P

If the system is linear AND causal, output cannot precede the input.

contrapositive: P implies not (L and C) = not L or not C.

for time invariance, we don't have to insist that the input is zero up to a
point; it just has to be (any) constant. Output also doesn't have to be
zero; it just has to be constant (not necessarily the same constant,
obviously).

(TI and C) implies not P
contrapositive: P implies not TI or not C.

anti-causality is defined as the exact opposite of causality. Everything
we've said about causality, the inequalities change sign.

Bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability.
----------------------------------------------
if |x(n)| ≤ Bx (∃Bx < ∞)
→ ∃ 0 < By < ∞ s.t. |y(n)| ≤ By ∀n

every FIR (finite-duration impulse response filter) is BIBO stable.

LTI (linear time-invariant) systems
-----------------------------------

x(n) can in general be decomposed into into a linear combination of
impulses. (Krönecker deltas). x(n) = ∑_{m=-∞}^∞ x(m)δ(n-m). (sifting
property)

If you know the response of the LTI system to the unit impulse, you know
the response to all discrete-time inputs -- decompose it into unit
impulses.

convolution sum.
x(n) = \sum_m x(m) \delta(n-m)
y(n) = \sum_m x(m)f(n-m)
y(n) = (x * f)(n)
y(n) = \sum_m^\infty x(m)f(n-m) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty f(k)x(n-k)
= (f*k)(n)

\therefore x * f = f * x.

You can reverse the roles of the impulse response and the input signal.

Let x(n) = e^{iomegan}. y(n) = F(omega) = (∑_k f(k)e^{-iωk})e^{iωn}.
Frequency response of this LTI system.

Converges nicely iff the system is BIBO-stable. The frequency response of
the system will be a very smooth function of omega.

BIBO stability for LTI systems
------------------------------

An LTI system F is BIBO stable iff its impulse response converges
(absolutely summable in discrete case or integrable in continuous case).

IF the impulse response is absolutely summable, then F is BIBO stable
(every bounded input produces a bounded output).

y(n) = ∑_k f(k)x(n-k) (I/O relation for an LTI system).
|y(n)| = |∑_k f(k)x(n-k)| ≤ ∑_k |f(k)||x(n-k)|
|x(n)| ≤ Bx ∀n.           ≤ (∑_k |f(k)|)Bx

F is BIBO stable → ∑_n |f(n)| < ∞

contrapositive. i.e. we can find at least one bounded input that produces
an unbounded output.

(fudge something to cancel out signs; we create our absolute sum over all
integers @ n=0. convolve signal with time-reversed signal;
auto-correlation. convolution of a signal with itself.)

(f(n))²/|f(n)| = |f(n)|²/|f(n)| = |f(n)|

IIR Filters
-----------
y(n) = lphay(n-1) + x(n).
causal, y(-1) = 0.

(geometric sum; BIBO stability depends on magnitude of lpha being less than
1.)
