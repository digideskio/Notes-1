EE 120: Signals and Systems
===========================

DTFS
====

x(n) = ∑X{k}e^{ikomega₀n}. The complex exponentials form a basis for C2. The
way we define inner products for signals is exactly as you'd
imagine. ∑Ψ{k}(n) Ψ⋆{l}(n). Frequency periodicity: Ψ{k+p} ≡ Ψ{k}. Only in
discrete-time periodic case are our functions guaranteed to be both
periodic in time as well as frequency.

blarg, x(n) = cos(n) not periodic in discrete time ⇒ no DTFS.

Evidently there will be a quiz on Tue, since pset is due on Wed.

Consider what it means to send discrete-time periodic signals through
LTI systems.
