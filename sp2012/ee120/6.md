EE 120: Signals and Systems
===========================
February 2, 2012.
-----------------
DTFS
====
$x(n) = \sum X_k e^{ik\omega_0n}$. The complex exponentials form a basis
for $\mathbb{C}^2$. The way we define inner products for signals is exactly
as you'd imagine. $\sum \psi_k(n) \psi^*_l(n)$. Frequency periodicity:
$\psi_{k+p} \equiv \psi_k$. Only in discrete-time periodic case are our
functions guaranteed to be both periodic in time as well as frequency.

$x(n) = cos(n)$ not periodic in discrete time $\implies$ no DTFS.

Evidently there will be a quiz on Tue, since pset is due on Wed.

Consider what it means to send discrete-time periodic signals through
LTI systems.
