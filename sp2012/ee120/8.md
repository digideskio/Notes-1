Discrete-time Fourier transform
===============================

Discrete aperiodic signals. The DTFT can also handle discrete-time periodic
signals, provided that we make use of Dirac deltas in the frequency
domain. You all should remember that the frequency response of a
discrete-time LTI system H(ω) = ∑h(ℓ)e^{-iωℓ} [DTFT analysis equation]. It
turns out this is the DTFT of the impulse response.

How to go from frequency domain to time domain, i.e. how to derive impulse
response from frequency response.

Our goal is to determine h from H. That's what we want to do. And I'm going
to do this in two ways, both of which rely on things we've already done. So
there's nothing new that I'm going to go through.

Recall: With discrete LTI systems: frequency response has fundamental
period 2π. H(ω+2π)=H(ω). We already possess the mathematical machinery to
handle periodic continuous variables (i.e. we've seen this in the
CTFS). Then, our continuous variable was time. Now, it's frequency.

Recall CTFS. x(t). p: fundamental period. ω₀ = 2π/p: fundamental
frequency. We said we can express x as a linear combination of complex
exponentials that are harmonics (integer multiples) of the fundamental
frequency. We had an expression for these. X{k} = (1/p)∫x(t)e^{-ikωt}.

I'm going to draw parallels now with the current scenario:
x→H. t→ω. p→2π. ω₀=2π/p→Ω₀=2π/2π=1. ∴ X{k} = h(-k).

Let k≡-ℓ in equation (⋆). H(ω)=∑h(-k)e^{ikΩ₀ω}.

Our coefficients are the h(-k) = 1/(2π)∫{2π}H(ω)e^{-ikω}dω. This is exactly
parallel to the previous expression.

h(ℓ) = (1/2π)∫H(ω)e^{iℓω}dω. Synthesis equation.

DTFT equations:
H(ω) = ∑h(n)e^{-iωn}.
h(n) = (1/2π)∫H(ω)e^{iωn}dω.

h(n) = ∫(dωH(ω)/2π)e^{iωn}. Linear combination of complex
exponentials. H(ω) is a measure of the contribution of frequency ω to the
function h.

For now, we're working with the universe of functions of the continuous
variable ω which happen to be periodic with period 2π.
