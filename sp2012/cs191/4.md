Ignore Q4 on HW2. Probably.

Entanglement
============

Last time, we saw a Bell state (a Bell basis state). This is a state
of two particles (i.e. two qubits), and the state of each of the
qubits is "entangled", so to speak, with the other of the qubits.

This state has a very curious property, as we saw last time: maximally
entangled qubits will remain maximally entangled regardless of the
choice of bases, as long as they are orthogonal. This is known as the
ROTATIONAL INVARIANCE OF BELL STATES.

For the bell basis state α₀₀|00〉 + α₁₁|11〉, we have rotational
invariance for _real_ rotations only. Certain bell bases additionally
have rotational invariance over complex rotations.

FACT 1:

	You get the same outcome if measure both in the v, v⊥ basis.

FACT 2:

	Independent of separation between particles. It's not because
    the particles are close to each other and talking to each
    other; it's because of their state.

Einsten, Podolsky, & Rosen '35:

    Imagine that you have a pair of particles that are emitted
	(e.g. electron, positron) that are highly entangled. They are
	emitted in opposite directions and travel far from each other. And
	then you measure Particle 1 in bit (0/1) basis ⇒ knowledge of the
	bit on the other particle. Also, measure Particle 2 in the sign
	basis ⇒ knowledge of the sign on the first particle. Contradicts
	uncertainty principle?

	Not at all. { sign information destroyed, etc. } Sign information
	measured in the second particle has nothing to do with that of the
	first particle, since measuring the bit information destroyed the
	sign information (i.e. is now entirely unknown). { more questions
	regarding the Einstein/deterministic interpretation of quantum
	mechanics. }

Bell '64:

	Take two entangled particles. Despite large separation distance,
	they are quantumly connected. What you can do is start playing
	with the notion of measuring the particles in arbitrary
	bases.

	Make one measurement with outcome u. You'd have |v〉 and |v⊥〉
	with probabilities cos²θ and sin²θ.

	Bell's idea was this: Surely, if you play with your choice of u
	and v, you're going to get something good.

	We have some input, 0 or 1, that tells us which basis to
	pick. Suppose there are two experimentalists who have these
	entangled pairs of qubits. At the last minute, Alice gets as input
	some random bit; likewise, Bob gets some other random bit.

	We want to know the two output bits.

	Goal: maximize probability that r{a}r{b} = a + b (mod 2) = a ⊕ b

	    If either of the inputs is a zero, they want to output the same
		bit. But if both of the inputs are one, they want to output
		opposite bits.
	
	Fact: If you choose the correct angles, in the quantum world, you
	get a success probability of cos²(π/8) ≈ 0.85.

	Claim: no way to do better than 3/4, if you agree to say the same
	thing in advance. (Local) hidden variable theory ≤ 0.75. Impossible
	to do better.

	However: Quantum mechanics gives us a success rate of ≈ 0.853, or
	cos²(π/8).

Alice's protocol is as follows: if r{a} = 0, measure in basis rotated
↻ π/16.  if r{a} = 1, measure in basis rotated ↺ 3π/16.

Bob protocol is as follows: if r{b} = 0, measure in basis rotated
↺ π/16.  if r{b} = 1, measure in basis rotated ↻ 3π/16.

{ where did these angles come from? If you plot them on the number
  line, you get four points a₁, b₀, a₀, b₁. When either is zero, we
  have a distance of π/8, else we have a distance of 3π/8. }

For the cases where (a ⊕ b), we have probability cos²(π/8). for the
case where !(a ⊕ b), we have probability sin²(3π/8) = cos²(π/8).

Conclusively disproves Einstein's hidden-variable theory.

There's this remarkable aspect where over time you can refine these
concepts to the point that we can sit down in an hour and a half to
understand these concepts that Einstein would have given anything to
understand. Isn't this remarkable?

When you actually do these experiments, they turn out to refute the
entire plan Einstein had.
