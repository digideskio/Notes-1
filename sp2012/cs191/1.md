What is Quantum Computation?
-------
* Computers based on quantum mechanics can solve certain problems
  exponentially faster than classical computers, e.g. factoring
  (Shor's algorithm).

* How to design quantum algorithms?
  + Requires different methodology than for classical algorithms
* Are there limits to what quantum computers can do? (Probably. Is not
  known to automatically solve NP-complete problems. Also, halting
  problem.)
* How to implement quantum computers in the laboratory (AQC, among
  other forms).
  + Can you design them so they're scalable?

Quantum computation starts with this realization that if we were to
base our computers on QM rather than classical physics, then they can
be exponentially more powerful.

This was really a big deal because it was believed that it didn't
really matter how you implemented computers; all that you could do was
make each step faster.

The fact that there's something like quantum computers that can be
exponentially faster, this was really a big surprise. And really on
fundamental problems, like factoring.

What this course will focus on is several questions on quantum computers.

Where we are for quantum computers is sort of where computers were
60-70 years ago.
* Size -- room full of equipment
* Reliability -- not very much so
* Limited applications

Ion traps.
------
Can trap a small handful of ions, small number of qubits. No
fundamental obstacle scaling to ~40 qubits over next two years.

Entanglement
------
Basic resource in quantum mechanics. Unique aspect of QM, and one
fundamental to quantum computing

Quantum Teleportation
------
Entanglement.

Quantum Cryptography
------
Ways to use QM to communicate securely (still safe even with Shor's).

This course
------
* Introduction to QM in the language of qubits and quantum gates.
* Emphasis on paradoxes, entanglement.
* Quantum algorithms.
* Quantum cryptography.
* Implementing qubits in the laboratory -- spin...

There are certain difficulties you can sweep away by focusing on it in
this language. It also highlights certain aspects of QM. Interesting
to focus on these aspects because they lend an alternative
interpretation of QM.

Aside:
------
There will not be programming projects. There will be a couple of
guest lectures. (not clear it will happen) would try to set things up
so we could go and play with equipment in lab. This obviously depends
on whether it scales and is set up well enough. Might be in place by
the end of the semester.

One thing that has to be done is arrange discussion sections. (under
discussion. Looks like a tentative Wed 11-12 and Fri 1-2.)

INTERIM.

Young's double-slit experiment.
----------
(particle-wave duality at quantum level. Physics completely
different. So different that it defies reason.)

There are two aspects of dealing with QM: understanding what those
rules are, and believing that nature works that way.

Hopefully you'll suspend your disbelief and just go with understanding
what the rules are.

(blah, more particle-wave duality)

(this basically boils down to interference.)

(tracking which slit each particle goes through leads to a collapse of
 the wavefunction, and we observe particles behaving like particles,
 not waves)

(talk about superposition of states; introduction of the wavefunction.
 Explained entirely by Schr√∂dinger's cat.)

The thing that's most troubling about this from actual experience as
well as physics is that there has to be a mechanism. How did nature do
this? We are going to have a completely precise description. But it's
not going to be a mechanism unlike anything else.

Part of understanding QM is coming to terms psychologically with this
superposition of states, the existence in more than one state
simultaneously.
