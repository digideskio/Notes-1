Schrödinger's Equation -- Feb 9, 2012
-------------------------------------

Had the sense last time that some of you might not remember all of your
linear algebra. So this time is a hybrid of linear algebra and getting you
up to speed with this bra-ket notation.

What we are going to be doing is looking at it from three or four different
viewpoints to try to get an intuition for why it is the way it is. So when
we get around to trying to solve the SE for specific equations, it's not
just an equation; you have a feel for it.

Goal for today: Figure out why does the Hamiltonian plays a role in
Schrödinger's equation.

So basically, the way we are going about this is that last time, we had a
rather abstract formulation of Schrödinger's equation. Why? It's because
the formulation is so clean. General form: write out hamiltonian,
diagonalize it, and once you understand the eigenvalues and eigenvectors,
you understand why it has the form it does.

So why does it look the way it does? Conservation laws.

Next week, we'll look at it for concrete systems; for continuous systems;
the behavior of an unstrained particle. In each of these cases, we're
trying to build an intuition as to _why_ the Schrödinger equation is the
way it is.

Not going to get into time-dependent hamiltonians until maybe the end of
the semester.

Do Hamiltonians correspond to quantum circuits? The way you implement gates
is by implementing a suitable Hamiltonian. But a quantum circuit
corresponds to a time-varying Hamiltonian. Topics we'll get to closer to
the end of the semester.

What we are starting with are the basics of quantum mechanics. Viewing it
in the case of discrete systems, i.e. qubits. We've already started with
quantum gates, quantum circuits.

We're going back and forth between this abstract version which is very
close to axiomatic quantum theory (but also helps with the understanding of
theory), and physical systems (hamiltonians). After a few weeks of physical
systems, we'll start talking about quantum algorithms.

And then, after we have developed that for a little while, how do you
implement all this in a lab? We'll go back and look at the physics of it.

We're sort of walking this fine line between thinking about quantum devices
as abstract entities; where all you need to know is the axioms of quantum
mechanics; thinking about what you can and cannot do, and what you have to
do to make it all happen.

So let's start with the basics. What I'll do today is I'll describe in a
little more detail Dirac's bra-ket notation. We've already seen this
notation to some extent, but let's do this more systematically.

Remember if you have a k-state quantum system, then its state is described
by a unit vector in a k-dimensional Hilbert space. This is also
equivalently described in ket notation as α{j}|j〉. We love this notation
because it simultaneously highlights two aspects: this is a vector, and it
is information. For example, if k=2, this is a qubit storing a bit of
information.

The dual space (row space) of this, if you write this state as |Ψ〉, is the
bra 〈ψ| (hermitian conjugate). The inner product (square of the length of
the vector) is simply 〈Φ|Ψ〉

People who love the bra-ket notation love it because you don't have to
think. You just do what seems right and everything magically works out.

So if you have a vector |Ψ〉, you can talk about the projection operator
projecting onto |Ψ〉. It's a linear operator. What you want to do is design
the projection operator onto Ψ (often denoted by P) ≡ |Ψ〉〈Ψ|.

Pⁿ should ≡ P, for obvious reasons. |Ψ〉〈Ψ|Ψ〉〈Ψ|: 〈Ψ|Ψ〉 = 1, so
multiple applications of an operator are equivalent to a single
application.

Suppose |Ψ〉=|0〉. What does P look like as a matrix?
[1 0 ... 0]
|........0|
|........0|
[0 0 ... 0]

I = ∑|j〉, therefore. It doesn't have to be in terms of the standard
basis. You could write down the identity in terms of any basis in this
way. Physics refers to this as the "resolution of the identity".

Example
-------

Suppose you have a vector and you want to measure it in a general basis.

What happens if we measure |Ψ〉 in the |v〉, |v^{⊥}〉 basis? Do a change of
basis on Ψ. Project Ψ onto each of the basis vectors. This is one way of
doing it.
