Now, let me tell you what quantum algorithms look like. You have your
qubits feeding in, and you might have your input x, have a number of work
qubits initialized to $\ket{0}$, and you have your outputs. What we might
do is measure some subset of your output bits. And then what you might do
some classical post-processing.

So what happens inside the box? Inside the box, you have quantum gates that
form some sort of circuit.

For us, the star is the Hadamard transform (for now). Later, it'll be the
QFT, but the Hadamard is a good place to start.

Remember what we said was that we had n qubits. We'll call this $H^{\otimes
n}$ (an n-fold tensor product of 1-fold Hadamards). Suppose $H^{\otimes
n}\ket{0^n}$. What's the output? $\sum_{\ket{x}\in \{0,1\}^n} \frac{1}
{\sqrt{2}^n}\ket{x}$. Suppose $u$ is some n-bit string. Now what's the
output?
