CS 191: Qubits, Quantum Mechanics and Computers
===============================================
Qubits, Superposition, & Measurement -- January 24, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------
Snafu with the projections, so lecture will be on the whiteboard! Will
also stop early, unfortunately.

State of a single qubit is a superposition of various states (cosθ|0〉
+ sinθ|1〉). measurement has effect of collapsing the superposition
(WAVE FUNCTION).

(hydrogen atom: electron can be in ground state or excited state.)

Now we study two qubits!

TWO QUBITS
==========
Now you have two such particles, and we want to describe their joint
state, what that state looks like. Classically, this can be one of
four states. So quantumly, it is in a superposition of these four
states. Our |ψ〉, then, is α₀₀|00〉 + α₀₁|01〉 + α₁₀|10〉 + α₁₁|11〉.
Collapse of the wavefunction occurs in exactly the same manner.

Probability first qubit is 0: |α₀₀|² + |α₀₁|². New state is a
renormalization of the remaining states.

ENTANGLEMENT
============
First, let me show you what it means for two qubits not to be
entangled. Essentially, we have conditional independence.

Quantum mechanics tells us that this is a very rare event (i.e. it
almost never happens).

Bell State
----------
You have two qubits in the state (1/√2)|00〉 + (1/√2)|11〉. Impossible
to factor, so we must have some sort of dependence occurring. Neither
of the two qubits has a definite state. All you can say is that the
two qubits together are in a certain state.

Rotational invariants of Bell states -- maximally entangled in all
orthogonal bases.
