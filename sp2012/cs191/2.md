Qubits, Superposition, & Measurement -- January 19, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------
Quantization:
-------------
 * Atomic orbitals: Electrons within an atom exist in quantized energy
   levels. Qualitatively -- resonating standing waves. (We have Bohr
   to thank for this)
   + The important thing is that there is this quantization, and you
     can choose to think of the ground/excited state of an electron as
     encoding in binary. Or you can have a k-level system, where you
     have energy levels 0 through k-1. These are the things we'll be
     thinking about notationally.
   + There are other systems we can think of as a two-level system,
     e.g. photons (in terms of polarization, e.g.)
     - spin (very roughly magnetic moment associated with the charge)
 * These are very rough descriptions. For our purpose, you can think
   about k-level systems, where you have k discrete levels.

Superposition
-------------
The first axiom of quantum mechanics is the superposition
principle. It says that if a system can exist in one of two states,
then it can also exist in a linear superposition of said
states. Likewise, if it can exist in k states, it can also exist in a
superposition of all k states (trivial to prove)

In other words, α₁|0〉 + α₁|1〉 + ... + α_{k-1}|k-1〉

Our α_i are actually probability amplitudes. These don't sum to one;
rather the magnitudes of their intensities sum to one.

(some talk about normalization in order to satisfy said property)

What does this superposition principle correspond to? We talked about
the double-slit experiment. Electron/photon going through one of two
slits, probability of which slit corresponds to these.

Measurement
-----------
The second axiom of quantum mechanics is the measurement axiom. The
superposition is the private world of this system. As long as you're
not looking at it, it's going to be in this linear superposition. But
as soon as you make a measurement, the outcome of the measurement is
one of these levels |j〉 with probability |α_j|² (i.e. you collapse
the wave function).

So if you go back to our last example, there we have a qubit (a
quantum bit) -- a two-level system is called a quantum bit because
it's a quantum analogue of a bit. So we had an example where we had a
superposition of two states. (demonstration of the probabilities)

[ talk about how attempting to detect which of the slits the particle
  went through actually constitutes a measurement, which changes the
  state of the system ]

  standard basis measurement:
     checking exactly which state the system is in.

Another way of writing the state of a quantum system (as opposed to
bra-ket notation) is just saying that it's k complex numbers and
presenting them as a vector. Should be immediately intuitive. We still
have the same condition that the summation of α_i² = 1. Our vector,
therefore, must sit on the unit k-sphere in k-space.

Ket notation: invented by Dirac. The reason we are going to be so
enamored by the ket notation is that it simultaneously expreses 1) the
quantum state is a vector in a vector space and 2) this quantum state
encodes information. The fact that we are labeling our states as |0〉
and |1〉 is indicative in itself that we are encoding information.

Two ways of rephrasing the probability of landing in a particular
state, therefore is 1) the length of the projection onto said basis
vector and 2) cos²θ_j.

Generalization of the notion of measurement: in general, when you do a
measurement, you don't need to pick the standard basis; you can pick
any orthonormal basis.

There is another useful basis called the sign basis: |+〉 and |-〉. If
placed on the unit circle, we have |+〉 located at θ=π/4 and |-〉
located at θ=-π/4.

[ change of basis can be done either using matrices or using
  substitution. ]

Significance of sign basis
--------------------------
The standard basis is going to correspond to a certain quantity. The
sign basis will correspond to a different quantity. By analogy, let's
assume that we're measuring the position or momentum of the system
depending on which basis we're using (might as well be -- Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle and all).

[ explanation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, except without
  actually attributing a name to it. basically, with two related
  quantities, the more accurately you know one, the less accurately
  you can know the other. ]

[ maximal uncertainty occurs with conjugate basis. measure of
  uncertainty: spread -- |α₀| + |α₁|. Corresponds to maximum
  uncertainty. Uncertainty ranges from 1 to √2. ]

Specifically, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: S(α₀) + S(β₀) ≥ √2.
(α₀, β₀ correspond to a conjugate basis)
