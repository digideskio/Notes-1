Heat engines, refrigerators, and Carnot cycle
---------------------------------------------
Historically very important: industrial revolution. Easy to do mechanical
work and transform to heat: mechanical, electrical. What about the
opposite? Not at the expense of machine itself: otherwise no cyclic.

Also has interesting physical importance: this was a new thing: how to
study energy? Joule showed there was an equivalence between work done and
heat released.

η = w/q₁ ≤ 1 - τ₂/τ₁. Equality holds only for quasi-static.

Carnot cycle: alternating adiabatic / isothermal expansion /
contraction. Maximum attainable efficiency for given τ₁, τ₂.

Reversibility
-------------

Entropy constant / always in equilibrium. Relaxation of constraints: if you
enforce the original constraints, and the system returns to its initial
state, it is reversible.

t{operation}, t{equilibrium}. t{o} » t{e}. Other possibility: t{e} ≫
t{o}. Also reversible. Becomes bad when these two are of the same order of
magnitude.

Clausius statement for 2nd law of thermodynamics: effectively, Carnot
engine is maximally efficient, given τ₁, τ₂. (q₂/q₁ ≤ τ₂/τ₁)

Joule-Thomson process: H = U + PV ⇒ H₁ = H₂ if dQ = 0.
μ ≡ V/C{p} (τlpha - 1)
