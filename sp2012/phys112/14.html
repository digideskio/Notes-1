<h1>Physics 112: Statistical Mechanics</h1>
<h2>Chemical Potential. Feb 22, 2012</h2>
<h1>Midterm</h1>
<ul>
<li>One page of notes. Clarification: One side of one sheet. No explicit
    ruling against oversized paper. Reasoning: it is always good to
    reconstruct what you have learned.<ul>
<li>Put things in your own terms and understand what you don't understand
  and why you don't understand.
  <mathjax>$\cdot$</mathjax> There are some formulae that are useless to understand. (n_{Q}, n,
    etc.) This is not a memorizing test. I would like you to understand
    the concepts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Will take about a week for grading.</li>
<li>No need for blue book. May want scratch paper if you like, but no blue
    book necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Exact differentials</h1>
<ul>
<li>Evolving system.<ul>
<li>Energy can be defined. Not necessarily useful.</li>
<li>Entropy can also be defined.
  <mathjax>$\cdot$</mathjax> <mathjax>$\sigma = \log g_{t}$</mathjax> only holds in equilibrium for an isolated system.
  <mathjax>$\cdot$</mathjax> In this case, it is well-defined by <mathjax>$\sigma \equiv -\sum p(t) \log p(t)$</mathjax>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Heat transfer is not an exact differential.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Chemical potential</h1>
<ul>
<li>Why is it called a potential?</li>
<li>Action mass law</li>
</ul>
<p>Most common state is such that the sum of chemical potentials is equal to
zero. <mathjax>$\mu_{i} = \tau \log (n/n_{Q_i})$</mathjax>.</p>
