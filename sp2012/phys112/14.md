# Midterm
  * One page of notes. Clarification: One side of one sheet. No explicit
	ruling against oversized paper. Reasoning: it is always good to
	reconstruct what you have learned.
	+ Put things in your own terms and understand what you don't understand
	  and why you don't understand.
	  $\cdot$ There are some formulae that are useless to understand. (n_{Q}, n,
		etc.) This is not a memorizing test. I would like you to understand
		the concepts.
  * Will take about a week for grading.
  * No need for blue book. May want scratch paper if you like, but no blue
	book necessary.
# Exact differentials
  * Evolving system.
	+ Energy can be defined. Not necessarily useful.
	+ Entropy can also be defined.
	  $\cdot$ $\sigma = \log g_{t}$ only holds in equilibrium for an isolated system.
	  $\cdot$ In this case, it is well-defined by $\sigma \equiv -\sum p(t) \log p(t)$.
  * Heat transfer is not an exact differential.
# Chemical potential
  * Why is it called a potential?
  * Action mass law

Most common state is such that the sum of chemical potentials is equal to
zero. $\mu_{i} = \tau \log (n/n_{Q_i})$.
