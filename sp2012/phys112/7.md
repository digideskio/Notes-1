homework #2:
exp(u² - 2ρuv + v²) ⇒ exp(u² + (v-ρu)² - ρ²u²)

Counting States: Discrete States
================================

With just counting states and some assumptions as to what pressure and
temperature are, we have PV = NkT and U = 3NkT/2.

Density of spatial states per unit phase space
----------------------------------------------

Phase space: Position space (x) ⊗ (p) Momentum space.

Density of quantum states (orbital states) is 1/ℏⁿ per particle (n ≡
dimensions). That is, if I have a volume in the phase space, I can count
the number of orbital states for one particle by dividing this volume by ℏ³
(in three dimensions).

The volume of the phase space is just the integral of (1/ℏ³)d³xd³p.

Now consider N particles in weak interactions. Total energy U is
constant. g = ∏∫d³xd³p/ℏ³ⁿ. Insert a δ(∑p{i}²/2M - U). Basically imposing
that the total energy of my system is U. The product of dx{i} will give
Vⁿ. So there is no problem there. But what about the d³p{i}δ(∑...)?
Imposing some of the p{i}²/2n to be equal to U. I'm looking now at the
surface of a sphere with a certain radius.

If we have one particle in one dimension, we have only one momentum
space. In large dimensions, g ∝ VⁿU^{³⁽ⁿ⁻¹⁾/₂}/h³ⁿ.

[ Reasoning: for momentum integral: we need to conserve energy. ]

[ We are basically speaking of the surface of a volume in 3N-space. ]

σ = S/k = log(g) = log(VⁿU^{³ⁿ/₂}) + constant
  = nlog(V) + 3Nlog(U)/2 + constant.

In that case, can write dU = TdS - pdV. Or, if you prefer, τdσ - pdV.

Solve for U: U = Aexp(2σ/3N)V^{⁻²/₃}.

τ = ∂U/∂σ = 2U/3N ⇔ U = 3NkT/2.

p = -∂U/∂V = 2U/3V ⇔ pV = Nτ ≡ NkT.
