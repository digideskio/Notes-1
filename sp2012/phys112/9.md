Physics 112: Statistical Mechanics
==================================
Entropy and Stuff. Feb 8, 2012
------------------------------

Divide g{t} by a missing N!, which is from indistinguishability of
particles / quantum states. Also, experiments were off by a very large
factor.

g{t} = Ω{3N}√(2MΔU)V^{N}U^{3(N-1)/2}/(N!ℏ^{3N})

Quantum density. What remains of our counting states.
σ = N(log(n{Q}/n+5/2).
n = N/V, n{Q} = (2πM/ℏ² 2U/3N)^{3/2}

Free expansion of gas (isolated system ⇒ no particle/heat exchange): final
temperature = initial temperature.

Entropy is increasing, however, since volume is increasing.

Chapter Three:

Equilibrium, Thermodynamics, Potential
======================================

RECALL:

1/τ =  ∂σ/∂U|V,N
p/τ =  ∂σ/∂V|U,N
μ/τ = ­∂σ/∂N|U,V

For an ideal gas in 3space:
U = (3/2)Nτ
τ ≡ kT
pV = Nτ

States of a combination of two systems
--------------------------------------

Take 2 systems and put them in contact.

Put them in weak interactions U = U₁ + U₂, V = V₁ + V₂, N = N₁ + N₂

Number of states g₁(U₁,V₁,N₁), g₂(U₂,V₂,N₂). Weak interaction ⇒ quantum
states are not modified.

How many states do we have in the combined system?
g₁g₂

What is the configuration of maximum probability? The number of states in
g(U₁,V₁,N₁)/g{t}. Take a derivative with respect to U₁ to see where the
extremum of this function is.

∂g₁/∂U₁ g₂ + g₁ ∂g₂/∂U₁ ≡ 0.
∂g₁/∂U₁ g₂ - g₁ ∂g₂/∂U₂ = 0.
(¹/g₁)∂g₁/∂U₁ = (¹/g₂)∂g₂/∂U₂.
∂log(g₁)/∂U₁ = ∂log(g₂)/∂U₂.
∂σ₁/∂U₁ = ∂σ₂/∂U₂.
1/τ₁ = 1/τ₂.
