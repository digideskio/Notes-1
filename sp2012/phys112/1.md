==================================
January 18, 2012

Goals

 * Deeper understanding of concepts: less mysterious.
   + Entropy
   + Free energy
   + Chemical potential
   + Statistical mechanics
	  - Fluctuations
	  - Kinetic theory background ← use of simulations
   + Recognition of physics in a "context-rich" situation, i.e. real life.
 * Acquire computational tools
   + Quantitative
   + Problem-solving skills
 * Linkages to
   + everyday life
	 - bridge between microscopic and macroscopic
	 - irreversibility
	 - engineering
   + modern physics
	 - frontier
	 - applications e.g. astronomy, cosmology
	   · condensed matter physics, low temperature
   + History

Participation

 * Focus: Conceptual Understandidng
   + We learn by construction/reconstruction of your mental models.
   + This process is both intensely personal and social (learn through
	 others)
   + focus on grades, formulae, short cuts
 * Before lecture
   + Read book and notes because our use of clickers which decreases
	 the in-class presentation time, there will be testing of this
	 reading.
   + Play with applet simulations → intuition. (You can suggest others
	 you can find)
* In class
  + Beginning of class: typically a conceptual question/applet
  + Peer instruction questions:
	- A conceptual question
	- Vote (with clickers)
	- Discussion in small groups
	- Vote again
  + Active participation during lecture: questions, clickers
  + "One minute" random quizzes (check attention to the material)
* Out of class
  + Homework
  + Working groups on problems if you like (but you write your own
	solution)
  + Discussion sections (but try homework first)
  + Office hours (come with questions)

Clickers:

* Systematic use in class begins Mon, Jan 23.

[ More boring administrative stuff; not particularly unique to this
  particular class. Largely duplicated from the syllabus. ]
