How a system reaches equilibrium
================================

Diffusion. True also in probability space. An isolated system tends to
evolve toward maximum flatness.

We won't speak classically of position + momentum, but rather of
states. Quantum states. The same thing happens in the case of probability.

It turns out that when all the properties are equal, we have maximum
entropy. Equilibrium occurs when "you are maximally flat".

Fluctuations
============

Fluctuations are the effect of life if you don't have an infinite number of
degrees of freedom. Which never happens. One of the fundamental properties
is noise. Noise is intrinsic to the finity of degrees of freedom.

Central limit theorem. Fluctuations decrease as samples increase.

Probabilities
=============

Probabilistic event: occurs in an uncontrolled manner, described by random
variables. parameters are fixed (even if unknown).

# Discrete case
 * consider bins.

An example of discrete probabilities is a histogram. Raw counts.

Cannot determine probabilities via experiments. Probability distributions
add up to 1. Probabilities cannot be negative.

# Continuous case
 * Actually a lie.

Moments. Stuff.
