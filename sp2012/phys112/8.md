So far:

σ = -∑\p log p   ✓

H theorem: with an isolated system, probabilities of states evolve to being
equal.

Consequence of the H theorem: If I am looking at the probability of a
configuration, the probability is equal to (states in configuration) / (total
states)

σ = log (g{t}) (mathematically equivalent to the first statement)

Counting of states to get the entropy.

Density of orbitals (quantum spatial wave functions) in phase space is 1/ℏ**{d}
(dimension of space)

Once again: phase space ≡ position space (x) ⊗ (p) momentum space. Good way to
compute the number of spatial states. degrees of freedom (spin, rotation,
vibration).

Number of states g(spatial states) of a system of energy U in a volume
V is g ∼ U^(³ⁿ/₂)Vⁿ = exp(σ). τ ≡ kT, σ ≡ S/k
τ = ∂U/∂σ)y ⇒ U = (3/2)Nτ
P = -∂U/∂V)σ ⇒ PV = Nτ

Just as natural, if not more so, to work with σ(U,V) ≡ log(VⁿU^(³ⁿ/₂)).

**We must be careful to note, when working with partial derivatives,
  which variables we are keeping constant.**

This is a very useful way of defining pressure and temperature once we have
counted states.

τ = 1/(∂σ/∂U)V,n, p = τ∂σ/∂V)U,n

We were starting with the phase space for our n particles. d³ⁿxd³ⁿp/(ℏ³ⁿ):
density of our states. We want to then integrate over the volume, but we choose
the states such that U fixed. Represents in our 3n-dimensional momentum space a
sphere.

δ[√(∑∑p²{ik}) - √(2MU)]. Take advantage of filtering effect of δ.

radius of sphere in 3N momentum space. r has dimension r^{d-1}. In the general
case, we'll have Ω³ⁿr³ⁿ⁻¹. 

Thus we have Ω√(2MU)³ⁿ⁻¹/ℏ³ⁿ.

δ has dimension of 1/p. ∫δ(x)dP = 1

Sackur Tetrode formula: entropy of an ideal gas. S/k = N(log(n₀/n) + 5/2)
