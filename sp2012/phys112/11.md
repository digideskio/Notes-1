Review of some thermodynamics concepts, laws and applications.
Thermodynamic functions: Maxwell relations
Heat engines, refrigerators: Carnot cycle.

dQ = dE + dW.

The laws of thermodynamics were developed by people who didn't use
statistics.

equilibrium: A↔B.

0th law: equilibrium. 1st law: energy (heat in the form of energy). 2nd
law: entropy of isolated system increasing.

An exact differential is a well-defined function in terms of multiple
variables x and y. Very important feature: conservative vector
field. Internal energy is actually a state function of the system, whereas
heat and work can be added arbitrarily. Place bars to denote non-exact
differentials.

PV = nτ: equation of state: relates observables with the system (pressure,
volume, temperature).

pV = νRT, TdS = pdV + dE. Therefore dS = P/T dV + dE/T. Since E = E(T,V),
dE = ∂E/∂T dT + ∂E/∂V dV. So dS = nR/V dV + 1/T (∂E/∂T dT + ∂E/∂V dV).

So dS = (νR/V + 1/T ∂E/∂V)dV + 1/T ∂E/∂T.

S = S(T,V). Also a state function. So we can write dS, therefore, as:

∂S/∂T dT + ∂S/∂V dV = ... ⇒ ∂S/∂T = νR/V ∂E/∂V + 1/T; ∂S/∂V = 1/T ∂E/∂T.

Working through the math,

∂²S/∂V∂T = 1/T² ∂E/∂T + 1/T ∂E/∂V∂T = 1/T ∂E/∂V∂T.

Specific heats: ∂Q/∂T while holding various parameters constant.

Adiabatic vs. isothermal expansion. γ ≡ C{p}/C{v}.
