EE 105: Devices & Circuits
==========================

----------------------

Today I wanted to keep talking about current sources, and, in that context,
supply-independent biasing. If we have time, I'll talk about voltage
references as well.

Tend to make square transistors even when they have absurd aspect ratios.

Zeners.

Family of curves that all look more or less the same.

Measuring temperature with diodes. Difference between single diode voltage
and triple-diode voltage. Roughly 100 uV/K.

Last bit of new material: diode itself, if I just have a diode and stick a
current $I_1$ through it, and I get some $V_D$ out, ... $I_s$ is wildly
nonlinear: $T^{3/2}$. PTAT!

Bandgap reference. Allows you to get at a fundamental property of matter in
our universe.
