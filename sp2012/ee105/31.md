Feedback:
---------
* Math
* circuits poles move
* stability and amplitudes

Nice mathematical abstraction of feedback with an amplifier with open-loop
gain given by A, and a feedback factor K, and loop gain AK. If we close the
loop, then we know that we get a closed-loop gain of $\frac{A}{1+AK}$. For
$\abs{AK} \gg 1$, this is approximately $\frac{1}{K}\parens{1 -
\frac{1}{AK}}$.

Turns out same analysis we do for amplifiers is the same we need to do for
oscillators. Circuits don't quite match this.

So let's do a little math, and example where I mess up and am too busy
thinking about the beautiful math. Single-pole amplifier with $A(s) =
\frac{A_o}{1 + s/\omega_{p0}}$. CLG is $\frac{A}{1 + AK} = \frac{A_0}{1 +
A_0 K + s/\omega_{p0}} = \frac{A_0}{1 + A_0 K} \frac{1}{1 + s /
\omega_{p,cl}}$. DC gain is the same, and then we've got some
frequency-dependent component. So we have $\omega_{p,cl} = (1 + A_0
K)\omega_{p0}$. Pole has moved: depends on how much feedback we provide. In
particular, if the amount of feedback I put into this thing is 0, then I
get the right answer.

So if we look at (the magnitude of) the open-loop transfer function, we
have this $\omega_{u0} = A_0 \omega_{p0}$. And now, as I add feedback, this
should not move.

Mathematically, as we change the loop, unity gain does not change.
