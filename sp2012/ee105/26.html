<h1>EE 105: Devices &amp; Circuits</h1>
<h2>Wednesday, March 21, 2012</h2>
<p>Midterm Friday; OBONNS.</p>
<p>Today: Graphing and calculating <mathjax>$G_m$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$R_o$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$A_v$</mathjax>, keep talking about
frequency response.</p>
<h1>Graphings</h1>
<p>So, the thing to do: you know you're going to have (if I've got
some <mathjax>$A_0\sin(\omega t) \mapsto \abs{H(j\omega)}A_0\sin(\omega t + \angle
H(\omega))$</mathjax>. If I give you a plot of angle or frequency, one way or
another, you've got to find the angle of <mathjax>$H(j\omega)$</mathjax>. Also, find max/min
voltages (determined by gain at various stages). Should make sure that those
points are marked (circled, even) so Pister can see that we know what's up.</p>
<p>If it's greater than 0, it's called <strong>"phase lead"</strong>. You want to find and
label and mark zero-crossings and min/max in time (which is really in
phase). Points move <em>left</em>.</p>
<p>If it's less than 0, it's called <strong>"phase lag"</strong>, and points move right.</p>
<h1>Calculating <mathjax>$G_m$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$R_o$</mathjax></h1>
<p>There have been some questions about this on Piazza. There's the basics,
like when you're looking into a collector or a drain, you're going to see
<mathjax>$r_o$</mathjax>; when you're looking into an emitter or a source, and the
collector/drain are at some AC ground, you're going to see <mathjax>$\frac{1}{g_m}$</mathjax>,
and then there's the blocks that you know and ought to recognize/use in
circuits, which are: what happens if I have some emitter degeneration or
some source degeneration (<mathjax>$G_m \equiv \frac{g_m}{1 + g_m R_s}$</mathjax> for MOS,
<mathjax>$R_s \equiv R_E \parallel r_\pi$</mathjax>); if I'm looking into the source/emitter,
then this looks like <mathjax>$\frac{1}{g_m}\parens{1 + \frac{R_D}{r_o}}$</mathjax>. Note that
for a BJT, you have <mathjax>$r_\pi$</mathjax> in parallel with this whole thing.</p>
<p>For example: steps for finding gain: <mathjax>$A_v = -G_m R_o$</mathjax>. In general, this is
how you'll find gain. <mathjax>$G_m = \frac{I_o}{V_i}\bigg|_{v_i=0}$</mathjax>. Straight
taylor approximation: this is why we set <mathjax>$V_o = 0$</mathjax> when calculating <mathjax>$G_m$</mathjax>
and <mathjax>$V_i = 0$</mathjax> when calculating <mathjax>$R_o$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>When doing <mathjax>$G_m$</mathjax> calculation, we just don't care about anything above the
junction.</p>
<p>Mentally, what people like Razavi do is say "aha! I've got a bias voltage
on that gate; this thing now is one of my basic elements! Aha! I've got a
<mathjax>$\frac{1}{g_m}$</mathjax> to ground, and now I can draw my small signal model." And
so the current coming out is roughly <mathjax>$g_m v_i$</mathjax>. The only time you look up
is if there's a current source up there that depends on one of the lower
node voltages.</p>
<p>The reason why we call it <mathjax>$g_m$</mathjax> is because it's <strong>mutual</strong>
transconductance.</p>
<p>So now we're not so sure. What I see is <mathjax>$\frac{1}{g_m}\parens{1 + \frac{1 /
g_m}{r_o}}$</mathjax> when looking into source.</p>
<p>So now we've figured out what our <mathjax>$g_m v_i$</mathjax> is. Current dividers.</p>
<p>So I wanted to do a couple more examples. For example, source follower
(recall, measure output at source). We know <mathjax>$A_v = -G_m R_o$</mathjax>. So what is
<mathjax>$R_o$</mathjax>? It's <mathjax>$\frac{1}{g_m} \parallel R_s$</mathjax>. <mathjax>$G_m$</mathjax> is a little tricky. Draw
the small signal model, then do KCL at the output node. Note that since
we're grounding <mathjax>$v_s$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$v_{gs} = v_i$</mathjax>, and no current is flowing through
the source resistance (or the output resistance, even!). Thus <mathjax>$G_m \equiv
-g_m$</mathjax>. What does this mean? We're shoving current out, instead of shoving
current in.</p>
<p>So finally <mathjax>$A_v = -G_m R_o = \frac{g_m R_s}{1 + g_m R_s}$</mathjax></p>
