Techniques in finding impedance, then homework.

Probably will be okay, but if not, stop me, and I'll explain.

So let's start with a cascode. What is the output resistance looking down
into the drain of the top MOSFET? $r_{o2} + (1 + g_{m2}v_{o2})r_{o1}$.

So now we want to find the impedance looking up into the source.

Impedance transformation. Explanation upcoming.

Here, impedance is the ratio between voltage and current. You need two
things to explain electrical conductivity. You need both voltage and
current. The relationship is called impedance.
