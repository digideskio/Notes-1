potatoes

$G_m$, $G_o$, $R_o$, $A_v$.

Graph of $I_C$ vs $V_{CE}$.

Process variation: $I_s$ and other values varying by some amount. Process:
$I_s$ varies $2^{\pm 1}$; Voltage: $V_{DD}$ varies $\pm 10\%$; Temperature:
$T$ varies $\pm 10$ (this affects values most -- $I_s$ depends heavily on
$n_i$ which is a strong function of temperature)

One solution for discrete amplifiers: emitter degeneration (source). You
put a resistor at your emitter. You know that if $R_E$ is very small, it'll
look as if it isn't there, and if it's very large, you get a follower (of
sorts). A change in the emitter current goes directly to the collector
currrent.

$G_m \sim \frac{1}{R_E}$ as $R_E$ large, and as $R_E$ small, $G_m \sim
g_m$. So what do I do? I draw the small signal model. I'm going to do it
for the MOS case so we can ignore $r_\pi$ (which doesn't actually change
anything).

more potatoes -- no current flowing, because they have no potential.

some textbooks are between the math and the potato.

derivations, more derivations.

Remember $A_v = -G_m R_o$ whether it's bipolar or MOS, which is equal to
$-\frac{g_m}{1 + g_M R_s}\parens{R_o\parallel r_o(1 + g_m R_s)}$. So if
$R_s \gg \frac{1}{g_m}$, we get $A_v \approx -\frac{R_D}{R_S} = -\frac{R_C}
{R_E}$. So you'll often make five resistors next to each other, and that
