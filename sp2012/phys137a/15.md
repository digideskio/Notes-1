Physics 137A: Quantum Mechanics

No cheatsheet. Won't need it. Mostly qualitative questions. One really hard
question for bored people. Five points. Believe it or not, we're catching
up on the homework. Too much turmoil, so these will just be in the
discussion sections.

So what we were doing last time, we were halfway through the wave
function. Derivatives have to be continuous, functions must be
continuous.

We know is that wave functions either break down into odd solutions or even
solutions. So solve each separately.

Standard solving of ordinary differential equations: write down general
form, then enforce boundary conditions.

\kappa is pre-propagation, so doesn't know about potential. k is
propagation.

Remember that this only gives us half of the solutions.
