Physics 137A: Quantum Mechanics
===============================
Friday, February 3
------------------

Observations:

 * Eigenvalues discrete

	 ⇔ imposed by boundary conditions
	 Ψ(x) = 0 at x = a/2, -a/2.

 * wavefunction with En ∝ n²

Properties
==========

* Even/odd states under reflection around origin
  + V(x) = V(-x).

* Wave functions differ by the number of nodes.
  + n - 1 = # nodes.

* Wave functions are orthonormal. 〈Ψ{m}|Ψ{n}〉
* Wave functions are also complete.

blarg, constructing fourier series (finally) and bra-ket notation
(only now?).
