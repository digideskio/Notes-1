Nothing that hasn't already been covered in statistical mechanics.

fourier transform blah blah blah

quaternions and stuff

Stationary states ⇔ solving the Schrödinger equation (time independent).

iℏ ∂Ψ/∂t = (-ℏ²/2m ∂²/∂² + V(x))Ψ
	     = (T + V)Ψ
V = V(x,t) = V(x)
Ψ(x,t) = Ψ(x)e^{-iEt/ℏ}

Eliminated time dependence with Fourier transform.

Time independent Schrodinger equation:
EΨ′(x) = [-ℏ²/2m ∂²/∂x² + V(x)]Ψ′(x)
Ψ(x,t) = Ψ′(x) e^{-iEt/ℏ}

Probability density is fixed over time. Very strong statement.

Such a solution is called a stationary state because the probability
density is independent of time. i.e. V(x,t) → V(x)

First big idea, stationary states.
〈Ĥ〉 = ∫Ψ⁺ĤΨdx

σ{Ĥ} = 〈H²〉 - 〈H〉² = 0. Stationary states have definite
energy. Eigenvalues.
