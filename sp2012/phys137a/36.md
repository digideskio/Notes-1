Klepsch-Gordan coefficients. Corresponds to unitary (and hermitian)
transformation between bases.

Fine-structure of hydrogen: taking into account spin interaction with
magnetic field induced by relative motion of proton (larmor precession)

Quadrupoles, nuclear spin, total angular momentum of electron. Angular
momentum of atom: $I_N + \vec{J} = \vec{F}_{\mathrm{atom}}$.
