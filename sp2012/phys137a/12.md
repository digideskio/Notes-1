Hermite relations:
∫Hm(y)Hn(y)e⁻{y²/₂}dy = √π 2ⁿ n! δ{nm}
H{n+1} = 2yH{n} - 2nH{n-1}
dH{n}/dy = 2nH{n-1}.

〈x²〉n = ∫Ψ*(x)x xΨ(x)dx. Use recurrence relation, then use first
relation.

〈p²〉 = mωℏ²(2n+1)/2. 〈T〉 = 〈p²〉/2m = ℏω/2 (2n+1)/2

σ{x}σ{p} = ℏ/2 (2n+1) ≥ ℏ/2 (n guaranteed to be non-negative)

Barrier presentation. Potential greater than energy.

Talk about free particles.
