Physics 137A: Quantum Mechanics

Pauli matrices. Electron in magnetic field.

Larmor precession. More stuff. Not quite the Bloch sphere.

Beyond SG machines!

Introduction to addition of angular momentum. Actually important! Reason
for picking this example: how to go further with hydrogen atom, now that
you understand spin.

People began to test spin carefully: explained Zeeman effect, explained
specific levels of hydrogen. Splitting of p(1/2), p(3/2). No degeneracy:
spin of electron interacts with orbital: magnetic field from relative
motion of proton (with respect to electron).
