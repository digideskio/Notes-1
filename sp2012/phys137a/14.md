finite square well???
=====================

# pset ->
	week from Monday.
# midterm ->
	no  Î´ function potential.
	yes Î´-function â‡” Fourier
	up to bound-state square well
# notes ->
	Saturday
# schedules/accommodations -> Thursday?

fourier transform! fourier transform!

Finite square well (finally)
============================

We'll set some zero energy, and a potential that has a depth of -Vâ‚€. This
is the base of our well. My wells are always symmetric around the origin,
and they always have width a. So we've got two regions: E > 0 and E < 0.

Negative energy: "is bound". It's just a shift of our ground. No physics
involved whatsoever. So we want to solve this problem. We'll do both bound
state and continuum solutions for this thing.

Curvature of the wave function corresponds to energy. If I look at the
energy (relative to 0) of the first and second eigenstates, the energy gaps
are going to be smaller than higher up.

Not an infinite number of energies, since it's not an infinite well. Gets
increasingly compact on the way up.

Continuous stuff.

Let's first consider stuff in our well. We've got two regions: x<-a/2,
x>a/2, and -a/2 < x < a/2. The first part is the free SE. Nothing
interesting there.
