Physics 137A: Quantum Mechanics
===============================
Monday, April 9
---------------

Recap from last time: stuff with Coulomb potential.

Talk about Laguerre polynomials.

As with Hermite polynomials, must self-truncate (some term $j_{\max}$ must
go to 0).

$\alpha \approx \frac{1}{137}; mc^2 \approx 0.511 MeV; \hbar c \approx 1973
eV-A$.

Hydrogen!
