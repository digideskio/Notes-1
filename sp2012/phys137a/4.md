Discrete distributions and somesuch.

moments and stuff. mean: first moment. variance: roughly second
moment. skewness: third moment. kurtosis (wtf?): fourth moment.

Moments are the analogue of derivatives for distributions. Sort
of. You also have derivatives, which aren't very useful, usually.

stuff with normalizing wave function, |ψ|² = ψ*ψ, etc.
