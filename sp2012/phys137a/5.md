Talk about using WolframAlpha to compute integrals.

blah, complex numbers. |Ψ|² ≡ ΨΨ*

Satisfying Schrödinger's equation in itself guarantees that
normalizing at a fixed point in time guarantees normalization for all
time.

[ derivations, consulting of notes. Correcting of errors. ]

[ working out expectation of momentum from the wave function. ]

〈v〉 = (d/dt)〈x〉 = [ℏ/im ∂/∂x]{Ψ}Ψ*
m〈v〉 = 〈p〉
\hat{p} = [ℏ/i ∂/∂x]

〈Ô〉 ≡ ∫[Ô]{Ψ}Ψ*dx

ΔxΔp ≥ ℏ/2
e^{ip·x}

Fourier transform of the Gaussian:
P(x) = 1/(√(2π)σ) e^{-x²/(2σ²)} = 1/(2π) ∫[cos(px/ℏ) e^{-p²σ²/(2ℏ²)}]∂(p/h)
