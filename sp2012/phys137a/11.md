Physics 137A: Quantum Mechanics
===============================

So, last time we were doing a harmonic oscillator. Calculation takes two
full lectures. Energy has to be quantized. Good first start. Lots of
motivation for the harmonic oscillator. Useful in general for lots of
different interactions. The first step is to define the time-independent
solutions. First thing to do is to introduce a dimensionless coordinate.
