Physics 137A: Quantum Mechanics
===============================
Monday, January 23
--------------------

Use of Mathematica/Matlab/WolframAlpha encouraged for homework.

Recap. Talk about _how_ uncertain, measured by product of two related
properties, e.g. momentum + position Schrödinger's equation.

Classical mechanics teaches us (incorrectly!) that physics is
deterministic. This is actually just the most likely path that you can
follow from point a to point b.

The issue is that we have Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, so it is
impossible to precisely know momentum and position simultaneously.

three primary interpretations of QM
 * Einstein - deterministic (hidden variables). Wrong.
   + "God does not play dice."
   + Not enough information to fully ascertain position of particle;
     must be an issue with the theory.
 * Copenhagen (Bohr) - nondeterministic. Widely accepted.
   + "orthodox position", 
   + Actually does exist in all possible results simultaneously until
     measurement is made and wavefunction is collapsed.
 * "agnostic position": who cares?
 
variance is 〈(Δi)²〉 = 〈i²〉 - 〈i〉²
