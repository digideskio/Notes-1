Anything prepared in an eigenstate stays in an eigenstate. But what if we
don't prepare our state in this way?

You can expand this wave function in terms of this complete basis, and you
have to write down the initial equations that you got. Guess. That guess is
right. iℏ∂/∂t Φ = [-ℏ²/2m ∂²/∂x² + V] Φ

iℏ ∑a{n}Ψ{n}(-iEn/ℏ)exp(-iEnt/ℏ) = ∑[a{n}exp(-iEnt/ℏ)[-ℏ²/2m d²/dx² + V(x)]Ψ{n}]

Summary
=======
# V(x,t) = V(x)
# We solve for special stationary states ⇔ [-ℏ²/2m d²/dx² + V]Ψ = EΨ ⇒
  complete set {Ψ, E} n ∈ N
  |Ψ|² = |Ψ|² end of time
# General solution
  Φ = ∑aΨ

〈Φ|H|Φ〉 = ∑|a{n}|²E{n}

stuff with conjugates and whatnot.
