Talk about solving transcendental equations by plotting. More room for
bound states as blue line gets larger. Intersections correspond to
eigenstates. If you're deep down in the bottom of an finite well, it should
look like an infinite well. Your probability of penetrating into the
forbidden region is governed by an exponential in $\kappa$.

Zero-energy bound state (parameter $V_0 a^2$ very small) corresponds to an
arbitrarily weak potential and arbitrarily wide well.

Similarly, the $\delta$ potential corresponds to $a \to 0$, $V_0
\to \infty$.

Talk about how the wave function has continuous zeroth and first
derivatives at boundaries.

Tunnelling makes the sun work.
