\section{Intro}
\label{sec:1}
Use of Mathematica/Matlab/WolframAlpha encouraged for
homework.

\section{Recap}
\label{sec:2}
Talk about how uncertain, measured by product of two related
properties, e.g. momentum + position Schr\"odinger's equation.

\section{warm fuzzies about the Schr\"odinger equation}
\label{sec:3}
$\hat{p} = \frac{\hbar}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$

$\hat{E} = i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}$

reduce equation to classical mechanics. Take this equation, let
$\hbar$ go to 0, and you get classical mechanics.

\section{Wavefunction}
\label{sec:4}
If you take a wave function, integrate its square from $a$ to $b$,
that is the probability of finding a particle between $b$ and $a$ at
time $t$.

QM is indeterminate. Doesn't tell you where the particle is; it tells
you where the particle is likely to be.
