Radial wave function, Exponential that goes like $e^{-r/an}$. Scale should
jump out at you. You get this feeling as you go to higher and higher
states, stuff gets weaker, and whatever. Solns to Lapl's eq on sphere;
worked out formula using Frobenius method. Worked out eigenvalue problem;
had to have Laguerre polynomials -- auto-truncating, not unlike Hermite
polys. Write energies that correspond to truncation in one of two ways:
electron mass-energy. Could also write in terms of distance.

Book's normalization is weird -- usual: either constant term is 1 or
highest-order term has coefficient of 1.

Our $L_j^p$ are gotten from the underlying Laguerre polynomials. The
Laguerre polynomials, going from the text's definition, is as follows:
$L_q(x) e^x\parens{\deriv{}{x}}^q\parens{e^{-x} x^q} = \sum_{k=0}^q (-1)^k
\expfrac{q!}{k!}{2}\frac{x^k}{(q-k)!}$. Thus our wave function $\psi_{n\ell
m} (r,\theta, \phi) = \bracks{\expfrac{2}{na}{3}\frac{(n-\ell - 1)!}{2n
\bracks{(n+\ell)!}^3}}^{1/2}e^{-r/na}\expfrac{2r}{na}{\ell}L_{n-\ell-1}^{2
\ell + 1}\parens{\frac{24}{na}}Y_{\ell m}(\theta, \phi)$.

Last couple of little properties: orthogonality. Must be careful with
orthogonality. A lot comes from the $Y_{\ell m}$s. Orthogonality in the
angular components enforced by $Y_{\ell m}$, which we've already shown.
