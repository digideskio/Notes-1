Physics 137A: Quantum Mechanics
===============================
Wednesday, February 1
---------------------
REMINDER: surfaces ⇒ boundaries.

Mostly duplicated information.

variance in energy is 〈H²〉 - 〈H〉² = 0.

proof of orthogonality; partial integrations and stuff. For two
different eigenvectors.

〈2|\hat{O}|1〉.

If you combine results with other results, we have a Krönecker delta.
∫Ψ*{i}Ψ{j} = δ{ij}.

The basic idea is that if you just focus on the time-independent
Schrödinger equation, it's quite powerful and used over and over again
in quantum mechanics.

 * First idea is time-independent solutions of the Schrödinger equation.
   + Basis vectors don't change over time.
 * Second idea is stationary states or eigenvalues or whatever (definite
   energy).
   + Basis vectors are eigenvectors.
 * Third idea is orthogonality.
   + These basis vectors are orthonormal.
 * Fourth idea is completeness.
   + This basis is a complete basis.

parity? arbitrary coordinates. V(x) is infinite outside the well, 0
inside the boundaries. We want to know how to solve that equation with
quantum mechanics. blah blah blah, construct Fourier series
already. Nothing interesting.

Ψ(x) = Asin(kx) + Bcos(kx).

We want our divergence to be 0. Continuous, zero at boundaries. Must
be zero at boundaries. THESE ARE BASIC BOUNDARY CONDITIONS.
½ka = π/2 + ℓπ  (ℓ ∈ \mathbb{N})
  a = (2ℓ+1)π/k

blah, constructing fourier series still
