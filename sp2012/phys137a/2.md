Historical review
=================
Planck: energy is infinite. (remove this paradox by quantization
of all matter.)

T{blackbody} > T{environment} → radiates

encountered contradiction by looking at higher and higher energy modes
in the box.

Incorrect implicit assumption was that energy is not continuous
(i.e. arrives in discrete "packets").

(dimensional analysis)

[ Planck radiation formula. ]

[ photoelectric effect also consistent with quantization of light. ]

de Broglie: particles behaving as waves, in addition to waves behaving as
particles.

(double-slit experiment)

"NOT an effect due to the interference of different photons passing
through the two slits. lower the light intensity so that on average
only one photon is in flight at one time. The intensity pattern is
still produced once the experiment is carried out long enough to
accumulate counts → the interference effect is a property of a single
photon. BUT pattern disappears if one slit is closed."

(superposition of multiple states.)

(Schrödinger's wave equation. blah. Dirac's relativistic version)

(uncertainty & conjugate bases)

(fourier analyses, more about uncertainty)

Schrödinger's wave equation
---------------------------
iℏ(∂ψ(x,t)/∂t) = [-(ℏ²/2m)(∂²/∂x² + V(x)] ψ(x,t) = H(x)ψ(x,t)
[ only one-dimensional, so far ]

Operators now written with a circumflex.
