Adders!

So back to carry-lookahead adders: propagate is XOR, generate is AND, and
kill is NOR.

Kogge-Stone: most common adder when optimizing for speed. False
paths. Humans still beat synthesis tools by thinking about how things work.

Next couple of minutes: what other outputs do we want out of our adder?
Your adder doesn't have as many as most: usually a set of four: NCVZ --
Negative, Carry-out, Overflow, and Zero. We're using two's complement, so
negative is just the top bit of the sum, carry is the top carry bit,
overflow is a bit trickier -- XOR top two carry bits. Zero is trivial.

Used to give exams with different number wheel (bias), but eh.

How to make a shifter? One-bit shifter: either 0 or 1. Use a bunch of 2-1
muxes, take input from either the same or one over (sort of like shift
registers). Need to be a bit careful at the top, depending on whether it's
arithmetic or not.

If it's a 0/2 shift, we can play the same game except take things from two
over. This, coupled with the 0/1 shift, will give us a 0-3 shift.

If ROT, muxes at the top have to be able to grab things from end of
array.

Finally, what if I've got left-shifts? Left-shifts are just rotates where
I've decided to shift in some 0s.
