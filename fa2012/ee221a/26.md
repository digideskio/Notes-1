Theorem: Let $(A, b)$ be completely controllable. Let $\hat{\pi}(s)$ be any
monic polynomial of degree $n$ with real coefficients. Then $\exists! f^T
\in \Re^n$ such that $\hat{X}_{A + bf}(s) = \hat{\pi}(s)$, where $f^T =
-\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & ... & 1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}b & Ab & ... &
A^{n-1} b\end{bmatrix} \hat{\pi}(A)$.

Proposition: Complete controllability is equivalent to saying $\exists T
\in \Re^{n\times n}$ s.t. $\tilde{A} = T^{-1}AT = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 & 0
& ... & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & ... & 0\\ vdots & \ddots & & \\ -\alpha_n & ... &
... & -\alpha_1\end{bmatrix}$.

This result is basically changing the basis; we define a new state $z =
T^{-1}$. That's why we're interested in this particular similarity
transform.

Recall what it means to be completely controllable. For LTI systems, we
have our tests for controllability, which are easy to check.

Controllable canonical form. Canonical means that once you get a general
matrix and you can transform it, the coefficients are all the same. In
fact, as we saw last time, these are the coefficients of the characteristic
polynomial.
