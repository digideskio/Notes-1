Multiple-input, multiple output; Observer design
================================================

The closed-loop matrix is the same; we always have the same structure:
we're feeding back an input equal to $Fx + z$.

Algorithm in LN 21; how to simplify problem by considering it as a
single-input system. Basically asks the problem "does there exist a
feedback gain matrix $F$ such that $(A + bF, b), b \in R(B)$?

State estimation: whether or not $\hat{z}$ is a good estimate of the
state. Measure error, which tells you how good your estimate is. Luenberger
model.

Theorem: if $A, C$ is completely observable, $\exists T \in \Re^{n \times
n_o}$ such that $\sigma(A - TC)$ can be placed arbitrarily in $\mathbb{C}$.

We can think about this problem by relating it back to the complete
controllability and placement of spectrum of $A - BF$.

If we look at the transpose of $A - TC$ (eigenvalues are preserved under
transposition), then we're back to the complete controllability case.

Don't typically move observer eigenvalues much farther than
needed. Stipulates that gain matrix is large; you'd have large gain in
feedback loop, which is typically undesirable.

Want observer to converge faster than estimate.
